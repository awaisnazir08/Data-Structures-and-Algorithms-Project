.\nWith 1.39 million first doses delivered to staff , that leaves 81,626 completely unvaccinated .\nIn November , the government estimated that 2 per cent of the total workforce would be eligible for

jabbed .\nTaken together , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 according to the current regulations \u2013 should be vaccinated , but are not .\nWe found that the NHS in London could be hardest hit , with nearly 8 per cent of staff still unvaccinated \u2013 followed by the West Midlands ( 3.3 per cent ) and the North West ( 3.2 per cent ) .\nOur figures tally with the government \u2019 s own predictions : in November , the Department of Health said it expected some 56,000 trust workers to be unvaccinated without an excuse by the 1 April deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c NHS and care staff

years , investigation finds Children younger than 10 are among the nearly 19,000 victims who have reported cases of image-based sexual abuse \u2013 so-called \u2018 revenge porn \u2019 \u2013 to police in the last four years , Channel 4 News can reveal .\nThis programme has received Freedom of Information responses from 34 of the UK \u2019 s 45 police forces which shows the scale of this devastating crime .\n18,700 cases of image-based sexual abuse were reported to police forces in England and Wales between January 2018 and August 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOur analysis shows that almost 80 % of reported victims were women and girls , while the majority ( 62 % ) of suspects were male .\nNearly 2,000 victims were under the age of 18 at the time the reported incident occurred , and 19 were 10 years old or younger .\nMore than 4,500 reports involved a partner or ex-partner .\nFreedom of Information data also showed suspects aged under 18 , with one as young as nine years old .\nOnline image-based sexual abuse can have devastating effects .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself aged 17 on a site dedicated to sharing private images of people without their consent .\n\u201c I was alerted by someone I knew from college from 10 years ago to the fact that there were somewhat explicit photographs of me on a website , \u201d she told Channel 4 News .\n\u201c It can derail your life , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It can put victims in a very vulnerable position in terms of work and family and relationships.\n\u201d She reported the incident to the police and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also been featured on the website .\nSo-called \u2018 Revenge Porn \u2019 became a crime in April 2015 , but just 4 % of the reported cases seen by Channel 4 News resulted in a charge or summons .\nCampaigners are increasingly calling for the crime to be referred to as image-based sexual abuse .\nRuby is now campaigning with a group called My Image , My Choice , calling for greater protections for victims of this kind of abuse .\nUnder the current legislation , prosecution depends on being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or videos intended to cause distress .\nSophie Mortimer from the Revenge Porn Helpline told Channel 4 News , \u201c We need to see that intention to cause distress removed .\nWe need to provide\u2026 anonymity for the victims , because it \u2019 s a form of sexual violence , and\u2026 there needs to be many more resources for victims in terms of getting this content removed.\n\u201d The legislation , she says , is out of date .\n\u201c Any new crafting\u2026 needs to be future-proofed .\nIt needs to be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time.\n\u201d \u201c I think there \u2019 s a real concern about the evolution of these behaviours .\nWe \u2019 re seeing younger victims with younger perpetrators .\nWe \u2019 re seeing collecting behaviour , trading behaviour ( where the victim and perpetrator don \u2019 t necessarily know each other ) .\nWe \u2019 re seeing manipulated images proliferating where the content is completely fake .\nBut it \u2019 s all causing harm .\nAnd that \u2019 s why we need to start seeing some redress or support for victims.\n\u201d For Ruby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also the police themselves : \u201c The bottom line is we didn \u2019 t feel fully supported by the police .\nBut then upon further investigation and discussion , we realised that the law doesn \u2019 t support the police to support us.\n\u201d She told Channel 4 News , \u201c the impact of this abuse online , particularly against women and girls , is really widespread .\nBut with these changes that we \u2019 re getting closer and closer to in the law , we \u2019 re closing in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls.\n\u201d A DCMS spokesperson told Channel 4 News : \u201c Our new laws set a gold standard for internet safety .\nThey will force online platforms to stamp out abuse and protect people from a range of illegal and harmful content including revenge porn .\n\u201c If they don \u2019 t , they will face huge fines and having their services blocked .\nBosses could be held criminally liable for failing to cooperate with the regulator.\n\u201d Produced by

officially left the EU .\nTo celebrate , the government has published a dossier titled \u201c Benefits of Brexit : how the UK is taking advantage of leaving the EU \u201d .\nBut four of these alleged benefits aren \u2019 t a result of the UK \u2019 s departure .\nThe report trumpets \u201c reintroduc [ ing ] our iconic blue passports \u201d as one of Britain \u2019 s \u201c achievements so far \u201d .\nBetween 1988 and 2020 , UK passports were covered in Brussels-approved burgundy .\nBut as Guy Verhofstadt \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Brexit spokesman \u2013 confirmed in 2017 , this wasn \u2019 t mandated by EU law .\n\u201c The UK could have had any passport colour it wanted \u201d while still part of the trade bloc , he wrote .\nIndeed , Croatia still has its own dark blue passport , nearly seven years after joining .\nThe report highlights another apparent Brexit boon : \u201c Enabling businesses to use a Crown Stamp symbol on pint glasses.\n\u201d \u201c The Crown Stamp is a proud emblem of our heritage that people remain fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of allowing it to be used once again , a fitting tribute to Her Majesty \u2019 s Platinum Jubilee \u201d it says .\nBut the BBC reported this month that an EU spokesperson confirmed that there was nothing stopping UK pint glasses containing the crown stamp while a member .\nThey said : \u201c EU law does not prevent markings from being placed on products , so long as it does not overlap or be confused with the [ EU standard ] CE mark.\n\u201d The report celebrates \u201c delivering eight Freeports in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\u201d As the independent think-tank , the Institute for Government , explains : \u201c freeports are a special kind of port where normal tax and customs rules do not apply .\nThese can be airports as well as maritime ports.\n\u201d But as regular FactCheck readers will know , the UK could create freeports as a member of the EU \u2013 and it did .\nToday \u2019 s report says that Britain will be \u201c using much less plastic , with much more recycled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our single-use plastic carrier bag charge has already cut plastic bag usage from larger retailers\u2014and , with its extension to all retailers last year , is expected to cut single-use plastic bag usage by 80 % .\n\u201d Ministers often tell us about policies that would not have been possible if Britain were in the EU .\nAnd reading this in today \u2019 s report on the benefits of Brexit , you \u2019 d be forgiven for thinking this is one of them .\nBut the charge was introduced in the UK in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the EU .\nMeanwhile , Brussels has issued a Directive since then calling for member states to reduce single use plastic bags .\nAnd while we \u2019 re here , we should say that the 80 per cent figure only tells half the story .\nWhen we look at all types of bags , including \u201c bags for life \u201d and tote bags , the policy is set to reduce usage by just 21 per cent \u2013 and it will take ten years to achieve this \u2013 according to Defra figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significant because while the government has focused its efforts on reducing single use plastic , there is evidence that other bags are not as eco-friendly as they first appear .\nFor example , you would have to use a single cotton tote bag 20,000 times to offset its environmental impact , according to research by the Danish government .\nAs part of a \u201c Benefits of Brexit \u201d report published today , the government highlighted four policies : reintroducing blue passports , using a crown symbol on pint glasses , establishing freeports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut two of these could have happened while the UK was a member of the EU \u2013 and two of them did .",

including Jobseekers \u2019 Allowance , Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit .\nWorkers on Universal Credit are subject to a \u201c taper \u201d \u2013 where the amount they receive in benefits goes

.\nThey intend to file a claim against Dyson in court , accusing the company of negligence .\nDyson rejects the claim .\nOn top of this , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was tortured by local police after concerns about unlawful working conditions in the factory were first raised in 2019 .\nOliver Holland , a partner at UK law firm Leigh Day , which is representing the workers , told Channel 4 News : \u201c Our clients allege that they work under conditions of forced labour .\n\u201c They lived in unsanitary and crowded accommodation , and they lived under the constant threat of punishment and

.\nThe Royal Malaysian Police did not provide a response .\nBetween 2019 and 2021 , Andy Hall , a labour rights activist in south east Asia , received repeated complaints from whistleblowers about forced working conditions at ATA and contacted Dyson to raise the alarm .\nIn early 2021 , Dyson was provided with further evidence of alleged squalid and overcrowded worker accommodation and reports of exploitation at the factory .\nThe allegations were so serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Border Protection .\nBetween November 2019 and June last year it conducted 5 audits of ATA , but no significant issues were found , and problems were quickly remedied .\nIn June last year , when a report about conditions at ATA appeared in a UK national newspaper , Dyson categorically denied the claims calling the report \u201c false and defamatory \u201d and subject to a legal complaint .\nFollowing the report , ATA sought to identify the whistleblowers , some of whom had their mobile phones seized .\nDhan

Nepal .\nMr Govindasamy and ATA categorically denies the claims made by Mr Limbu .\nWhen Dyson heard his story , it immediately launched its own investigation .\nThe company \u2019 s lawyers

backlog is being felt acutely in cases involving sexual violence , with the police and Crown Prosecution Service under immense pressure to tackle record-breaking low rape convictions .\nAmy Pearson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waived her right to anonymity to raise concerns over how police handle digital devices during investigations .\nShe claims that her phone was held by Suffolk Police for more than four-and-a-half years after she reported the attack the next day .\nInvestigating officers demanded information beyond relevant messages and pictures between her and the suspect , she alleges , and

\u201d .\nIn response , Western nations including the US and the UK have announced economic sanctions on Russia .\nSo how did we get here ?\nAnd what consequences could Russia face ?\nHow did we get here ?\nRussia has amassed an estimated 150,000 troops around the borders of its neighbour , and former member of the USSR , Ukraine .\nThis has led Western governments and media to express concern over a possible Russian invasion in recent months .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the fear is of another invasion .\nRussia has already invaded , and continues to occupy , part of Ukraine : the Crimea peninsula .\nUnderstanding what happened there is key to understanding the current crisis .\nLike many areas that border Russia , Crimea has a significant Russian-speaking population and there are some in the region who would like it to break away from Ukraine and become part of the Russian Federation .\nThose pro-Russian separatists had their moment in 2014 , when the Ukrainian president was ousted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Crimea .\nA few weeks later , Crimea declared itself independent from Ukraine following a referendum , which appeared to show huge support for joining Russia .\nBut a United Nations ( UN ) resolution said the referendum had \u201c no validity \u201d because Russian troops had already entered Crimea at the time ballots were cast and because the vote had not been authorised by the Ukrainian government .\nThe results themselves \u2013 which the separatists claimed were based on a huge turnout \u2013 were also called into question as ethnic Ukrainians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 d boycotted the vote .\nNevertheless , after the referendum , the Kremlin announced that Crimea had become part of Russia .\nThe majority UN members disagreed and continue to recognise Crimea as part of Ukraine .\nRussian troops still occupy the region .\nThe latest crisis involves two other parts of Ukraine , Donetsk and Luhansk , which are sometimes referred to collectively as the Donbass .\nBoth areas border Russia and , like Crimea , held disputed referendums in 2014 on whether to leave Ukraine and join their larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its response to these ballots , and unlike in Crimea , it declined to recognise the regions as independent from Ukraine .\nNevertheless , the Kremlin said the pro-independence results should be implemented .\nSince then , Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists have been at war in the area , with dozens of shaky ceasefires agreed ( and broken by both sides ) over that time .\nMoscow is widely accused of giving the rebels military assistance .\nPro-Russian forces shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in July 2014 with a missile launcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Dutch-led investigation , though Russia denies any involvement .\nMore than 13,000 people have died in the Donbass conflict , including over 3,000 civilians , in what \u2019 s been dubbed Europe \u2019 s \u201c forgotten war \u201d .\nIn this context , Vladimir Putin \u2019 s decision on Monday to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as \u201c people \u2019 s republics \u201d independent of Ukraine is considered very significant .\nHe claims that Russian-speaking civilians in the two regions are experiencing a \u201c genocide \u201d at the hands of Ukrainian forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give itself an excuse to invade .\nWe can \u2019 t see inside the mind of President Putin , but in a speech he gave last night he was clear that he sees Ukraine as \u201c not just a neighbouring country \u201d but as \u201c an integral part of [ Russia \u2019 s ] own history , culture , spiritual space \u201d .\nToday , the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov questioned whether Ukraine had a right to sovereignty , according to reports from the Russian news agency Interfax .\nAnd Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the invasion of Crimea nearly a decade earlier .\nBy recognising the two Donbass regions as independent of Ukraine , and claiming that there are human-rights violations underway there , the Russian president seems to think he can make the case for moving his forces into Donetsk and Luhansk .\nAnd that \u2019 s what he \u2019 s now done .\nThe Kremlin says the troops are there on \u201c peacekeeping duties \u201d , a claim that \u2019 s been met with scepticism in the West .\nThe US ambassador to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what they really are.\n\u201d Russia is already experiencing economic sanctions \u2013 where other countries impose financial measures or constraints designed to damage another nation \u2019 s economy \u2013 as a result of its actions this week .\nWithin hours of Russia \u2019 s decision to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics , the White House said it would ban US citizens from doing business in the regions .\nAnd the Biden administration says it will implement further \u201c swift and severe economic measures \u201d if Russian troops go beyond Donbass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine .\nMeanwhile Boris Johnson said today that the UK assets of five Russian banks and three wealthy Russian individuals would be frozen \u2013 meaning their owners can not move or access them .\nThe prime minister said it was \u201c the first tranche [ \u2026 ] of what we are prepared to do \u201d .\nAnd perhaps the most significant challenge for Russia so far is Germany \u2019 s decision to block the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline , which would take gas from northern Russia into Germany .\nSelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Russia \u2019 s economy , so the loss of this pipeline \u2013 which would have doubled its supply capacity on the continent \u2013 is expected to hit the country hard .\nLess than 5 per cent of Britain \u2019 s gas comes from Russia , but for the EU , the figure is closer to 50 per cent \u2013 so Germany \u2019 s decision will have knock-on effects for Russia \u2019 s customers in the West too .\nThose are just some of the economic implications of Russia \u2019 s moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a military response from Western countries ?\nCould we end up at war with Russia ?\nIt \u2019 s worth remembering that Ukraine is not a member of NATO , the military alliance that includes many European states and the US .\nThat \u2019 s key because NATO rules say that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all .\nIf Ukraine had been part of the

UK go to war with Russia and could there be nuclear conflict?", "content": "With Russia advancing on the Ukrainian capital , Kyiv , FactCheck readers are asking us two important questions .\nCould the UK and its Western allies end up at war with Russia ?\nAnd how close \u2013 or not \u2013 are we to a possible nuclear conflict ?\nCould the West go to war with Russia ?\nUkraine is not a member of NATO , the military alliance that includes Britain and the US .\nThat \u2019 s key because NATO rules say that an attack on one member is an attack on all .\nIf Ukraine had been part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion this week would have been considered an assault on all 30 NATO countries ( though whether he \u2019 d have gone ahead with the invasion under those circumstances is another question . )\nWestern nations have been providing indirect support to Ukraine without actually deploying troops or declaring war on Russia .\n( Ukrainian leaders have been very critical of what they say is a feeble response from their allies . )\nBut if Vladimir Putin decides to take the fight beyond Ukraine and launch an assault on a NATO member \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Latvia , Estonia , or Lithuania \u2013 this could all change .\nIf a member state is attacked , it can invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty , known as the \u201c collective defence \u201d clause .\nThat means it \u2019 s entitled to assistance from the other nations in the alliance .\nSo would that mean the UK going to war with Russia ?\nNot necessarily .\nDr Kenton White , lecturer in strategic studies and international relations at the University of Reading , explained to FactCheck that invoking Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other NATO states would send their armed forces.\n\u201d \u201c The Article is quite explicit that military action is an option which can be included in response to an attack , \u201d he added ( his emphasis ) .\nWe can see this in the broad wording of the treaty , which says each state will take \u201c such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force \u201d to protect the country that has been attacked .\nSo strictly speaking , even if Russia did attack a NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to declare war or send soldiers .\nThough , giving his personal view , Dr White says he \u201c would expect Britain to honour its obligation to fight \u201d .\nElena Korosteleva , professor of international politics at the University of Kent , told FactCheck that she believes Russia is \u201c unlikely to attack any NATO member states , as it would be a step too far , which would result in WWIII.\n\u201d Mark Webber , professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham , told FactCheck that while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his \u201c expectation/hope is that Russia is very well aware of the danger of any such action and would desist.\n\u201d Are we at risk of nuclear war ?\nRussia has nuclear weapons , but Ukraine does not \u2013 it gave them up in 1994 .\nProfessor Webber explains that \u201c nuclear war only becomes imaginable if Russia and NATO enter into direct conflict.\n\u201d But even if there was such a conflict , that doesn \u2019 t automatically mean it \u2019 ll go nuclear .\nThat \u2019 s because of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe phrase was coined in the Cold War , when the Soviet Union and the US competitively built up their nuclear stocks .\nThe idea is that if one country launches a large-scale nuclear attack on another , it \u2019 s effectively a suicide mission because both nations will end up obliterated through retaliation and counter-retaliation .\nThat prospect is so dire that , the thinking goes , even countries that have nuclear weapons will never end up using them \u2013 so long as their enemies have roughly equivalent arsenals too .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to \u201c strategic \u201d nuclear weapons \u2013 the large missiles that , if they \u2019 re used , are intended to secure some long-term overarching objective like ending a war .\nBut what about \u201c tactical \u201d nuclear weapons ?\nThese are smaller devices designed to aid one side in a short-term battle situation , where the doctrine of mutual assured destruction doesn \u2019 t apply .\nDr White said he \u201c would not expect Russia to use tactical nuclear weapons whilst invading Ukraine.\n\u201d There is , he says , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn Russia into an international pariah , far worse than a conventional attack.\n\u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t believe China would be willing to support their use by Russia , \u201d he added .\nHowever , Dr White says , if \u201c President Putin \u2019 s expansion over-reaches itself with an invasion of the Baltic States [ Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania ] \u201d there is a possibility that he might use tactical nuclear weapons to avoid defeat .\nNevertheless , we are a long way from this hypothetical scenario .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at war if Russia attacks a NATO member and the UK decides to respond with military might .\nAs Ukraine is not part of NATO , the UK has no obligation to make any military intervention so long as the fighting stays where it is .\nAnd we should stress : Russia has not yet attacked any NATO member and might never do so .\nEven if it did launch an assault , there \u2019 s no guarantee that the rest of NATO would declare war or take military action in response .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ with force , there are plenty of barriers \u2013 not least the prospect of mutual assured destruction and major loss of life on both sides \u2013 to prevent any country involved in a hypothetical future NATO-Russia war from deploying nuclear weapons .", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url":

"Britain is facing an exodus of social workers , the government has been warned , as a new report suggests staff are \u201c utterly exhausted \u201d by a soaring and more complex caseload .\nChannel 4 News has first seen a survey conducted by the British Association of Social Workers which suggests deteriorating working conditions are driving staff to leave .\nAround 72 % of social workers said they were unable to complete their work within contracted hours , while over 37 % said the volume of cases had not returned to pre-pandemic levels .\nSome respondents described their workload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 20 % saying they now wanted to leave the profession .\nGovernment workforce figures released last week revealed that nearly 5,000 children and family social workers quit their jobs last year in England \u2013 an increase of 16 % since 2020 .\nThe number of job vacancies is now at a five-year high .\nOne frontline worker who recently left the sector told Channel 4 News : \u201c Quite simply , there is not a safe space for social workers to be operating in.\n\u201d A government spokesperson said ministers \u201c recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and were providing councils with \u201c \u00a34.8 billion in new grant funding to help maintain vital frontline services \u201d .\nAndy , a social worker for a local authority in Merseyside , said his caseload had tripled during the coronavirus pandemic , with domestic violence and substance abuse driving referrals .\nHis concern has now turned to the impact of a cost of living crisis on safeguarding and the potential for cases to escalate quickly into \u201c higher risk situations \u201d .\nHe said he had witnessed an uptick in the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utilities and teams often being called out in the middle of the night .\n\u201c If people are ending up involved with social services because they are going to run out of electricity \u2013 that is a big deal isn \u2019 t it ?\n\u201d Asked for his current assessment of the social work landscape , Andy told Channel 4 News : \u201c My fear is we lose more social workers and those who are just clinging on .\n\u201c We have to listen to horrendous things happening to children .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t do this anymore , I \u2019 ve heard too much now , I can \u2019 t manage it \u2013 and it is impacting my own family.\n\u2019 \u201d The survey of more than 2,000 social workers across England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland also highlighted frustrations around staffing levels , cuts to local services and the volume of administrative tasks or so-called \u201c red tape \u201d .\nSpending on preventative children \u2019 s services fell from 41 % of council budgets in 2010 to 25 % in 2018 , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] .\nMounting pressures on children \u2019 s social care is predicted to lead to costs increasing by an estimated \u00a3600 million every year , the LGA says , with eight in 10 councils in England already said to be overspending their child protection budgets .\nExplaining why he chose to leave the profession , the former social worker \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 said : \u201c The system is so overwhelmed and stretched there will be occasions when the care for children isn \u2019 t good enough .\n\u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social workers having to make really difficult decisions about what they prioritise .\nThat can be draining when you \u2019 re always having to cut corners and always having to work gaps in the system .\n\u201c With the current trajectory , it is really hard for experienced social workers to stick it out.\n\u201d The report and warnings come at a time when child protection is firmly under the spotlight , following a spate of national headlines concerning the tragedies of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes , 16-month-old Star Hobson and two-year-old Kyrell Matthews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review into the murders of Arthur and Star .\nA safeguarding review into Kyrell \u2019 s death published last week found social workers and police missed vital opportunities to intervene .\nWhen asked to assess the public \u2019 s current perception of social work , an overwhelming majority of respondents to the survey said it was negative .\n\u201c It demoralises people , \u201d Andy said .\n\u201c I am trying my best here to protect children every day of the year , every hour of the year .\nIt feels like getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is perpetrators , criminals , monsters who do this stuff to children .\n\u201c But we also need to be accountable for our actions .\nIf I don \u2019 t do my job correctly , there \u2019 s big consequences and I have to be accountable for that .\nDr Ruth Allen , Chief Executive of the British Association of Social Workers , said : \u201c The sector continues to face challenges from years of chronic underfunding in social services .\n\u201c If there is serious intent by the government to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the sector the resources and funding it desperately needs must happen urgently.\n\u201d In response , the Department for Education insisted there were more social workers \u201c than ever in the profession \u201d and councils were being supported in the further recruitment of staff .\n\u201c There are a number of mental health services available through councils along with peer-to-peer support sessions for social workers to help them share best practice and the challenges they face , \u201d a spokesperson told Channel 4 News .\n\u201c We recognise the pressure on children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are providing councils with \u00a34.8 billion in new grant funding to help maintain vital frontline services , including children \u2019 s social care .\n\u201d", "author": "Channel 4 News", "url":

war crimes Russia is accused of", "content": "US president Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin is a \u201c war criminal \u201d and that information should be gathered for \u201c a war crimes trial.\n\u201d Moscow has previously said that such comments are \u201c unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric.\n\u201d Here \u2019 s what the laws of war say \u2013 and some of the ways in which Russia is accused of breaking them .\nAnd be aware : this article contains graphic descriptions and links to articles containing images that some readers may find distressing .\nRussia has caused hundreds of civilian deaths since this war began .\nIn order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 d need proof that Putin \u2019 s forces had meant to target them .\nBut even if it \u2019 s not deliberate , killing civilians can break international law in other ways .\nBoth sides have to make sure that any strikes are not indiscriminate \u2013 which means armies can \u2019 t just open fire on civilian areas .\nPutin \u2019 s forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol on 10 March , killing three people .\nThe Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that : \u201c All expectant mothers , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out \u201d of the facility by the far-right Azov battalion of the Ukrainian army , which Mr Lavrov claimed had turned it into their base .\nHad that been true , it could have made the hospital a legitimate military target , and helped exonerate Russia from a possible war crimes charge .\nApparently trying to support this assertion , Russian authorities accused women in the graphic photos and videos that emerged from the scene of being actors .\nBut these claims have been debunked .\nWe have plenty of evidence from reputable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the BBC and Sky News \u2013 that the attack and those pictured as injured in it are genuine .\nA week later , a theatre that was being used as a shelter in Mariupol was hit by an airstrike .\nThe Ukrainian authorities blamed Russian forces , but the Kremlin claimed the bombing was carried out by Azov fighters .\nAn estimated 300 civilians were killed in the attack , according to the local city council .\nEarlier this month , pictures emerged from the city of Bucha \u2013 which was until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show civilians having been shot and left in the streets .\nUkraine \u2019 s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the evidence emerging from the city points to a \u201c genocide \u201d of Ukrainians by Russian troops .\nSergei Lavrov said claims of civilian killings in Bucha were \u201c stage-managed anti-Russian provocation.\n\u201d There are also reports of Russian soldiers carrying out \u201c summary executions \u201d \u2013 when a person is accused of a crime and immediately killed without a fair trial .\nIf these reports are proven , they could amount to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says \u201c Russian forces in the village of Staryi Bykiv , in Chernihiv region , rounded up at least six men [ \u2026 ] and later executed them \u201d on 27 February .\nThe organisation also reports that \u201c Russian forces in Bucha , about 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv , rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them \u201d on 4 March .\nRape is illegal at any time , but it can also be a war crime if it takes place as part of an armed conflict .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution recognising the fact that sexual violence can be used as a weapon of war \u201c to humiliate , dominate , instil fear in , disperse and/or forcibly relocate civilian members of a community or ethnic group \u201d .\nThe Times spoke to a woman living near Kyiv who said that on 9 March , \u201c Russian soldiers [ \u2026 ] invaded [ her and her family \u2019 s ] home , stole from them and shot dead her husband before raping her repeatedly over the course of several hours.\n\u201d Human Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who told them that on 13 March , \u201c a Russian soldier had repeatedly raped her in a school in the Kharkiv region where she and her family had been sheltering [ \u2026 ] She said that he beat her and cut her face , neck , and hair with a knife.\n\u201d The Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko claims that girls as young as ten have suffered horrific injuries after being raped by Russian soldiers .\nShe also shared a photograph of a woman who was allegedly raped , killed and branded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when forces control the ways in and out of a city or town to trap people inside .\nSiege tactics can constitute a war crime if forces are bombing civilian targets inside the city \u2013 or if they block food , water or essential supplies from the people there .\nPresident Zelenskyy and the United States have accused Russia of doing this in Mariupol .\nOne woman who escaped the city told the BBC that children there were dying of dehydration .\nResponding to these reports , Moscow claims that it is \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c hostages \u201d , not Russian forces .\nOn 20 March , a Kremlin official said Russia would set up humanitarian corridors to allow \u201c nationalists \u201d to leave the city .\nBut Russia has repeatedly broken promises of a ceasefire along the routes that had been earmarked to bring aid to Mariupol residents .\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says thousands of civilian lives depend on these supplies reaching the city .\nRussia is also accused of deploying weapons that are so destructive that they can \u2019 t discriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their use illegal under international law .\nNATO officials said last month that Russia had used one such weapon \u2013 cluster bombs \u2013 as part of the invasion .\nThe Ukrainian authorities and the British government have also claimed that Moscow admits to using a banned vacuum bomb ( sometimes known as a thermobaric weapon ) .\nTaking civilians from their own country and moving them to another is a war crime , according to the laws of war .\nThe Ukrainian authorities say that Putin has forcibly deported 40,000 of their citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s not clear how many are civilians , but the officials say that \u201c many children \u201d have been taken .\nWhat happens next ?\nThe allegations we \u2019 ve looked at here are , for now , just that : allegations .\nThe International Criminal Court ( ICC ) has opened an investigation , which may end up including some of the incidents we \u2019 ve described above , and may include others we \u2019 ve yet to hear about .\nBut the Court has its work cut out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that war crimes or other violations of international law have been committed , it might struggle to bring any of the accused perpetrators to justice .\nThat \u2019 s because Russia has not signed up to the jurisdiction of the Court , and so a successful prosecution would likely rely on Moscow \u2019 s cooperation .\nWe just don \u2019 t know if that will happen .\nIt \u2019 s also unclear who would stand trial if charges were brought .\nPhilippe Sands , professor of law at University College London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a real risk you end up with trials of mid-level people in three years and the main people responsible for this horror \u2013 Putin , Lavrov , the minister of defence , the intelligence folks , the military folks and the financiers who are supporting it \u2013 will get off the hook.\n\u201d And some analysts warn that even if Putin himself were indicted , the process would likely take many years .\nOne previous head of state to face prosecution \u2013 the Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 \u2013 died before his @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Georgina

"content": "Like Boris Johnson , Keir Starmer has been doing the rounds on UK media ahead of the local elections this Thursday .\nThe BBC \u2019 s Martha Kearney put it to Mr Starmer that \u201c what the government has also done is it \u2019 s changed the threshold on [ national insurance contributions ] so that people who earn less than \u00a335,000 will actually see those national insurance bills drop \u2013 that \u2019 s according to research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\u201d The Labour leader replied : \u201c Well , most families will be much worse off.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax that workers pay on their earnings over a certain level and that employers pay based on the earnings of the people they employ .\nHow much you pay in NICs depends on two key elements : the rate of NICs , and the threshold at which it kicks in .\nThe NICs rate rose by 1.25 percentage points on 6 April this year .\nThat means the standard NICs rate for employees has gone from 12 per cent to 13.25 per cent .\nBut the government is also raising the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying NICs .\nThat change \u2013 which takes effect from July \u2013 means workers can earn \u00a312,570 a year before they have to start paying NICs , considerably more than the previous threshold ( \u00a39,880 ) .\nTaking account of the threshold change means that \u201c those earning less than around \u00a335,000 will see a fall in their overall NICs bill in 2022-23 relative to 2021-22 \u201d , according to the independent think tank , the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) .\nSo what about Sir Keir \u2019 s claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off \u201d ?\nIt \u2019 s possible that he was talking more generally about the overall cost of Conservative tax policies beyond NICs .\nBut this section of the interview was on the NICs issue specifically \u2013 so we \u2019 d expect most listeners to assume that that \u2019 s what this claim refers to .\nAnd whether or not it \u2019 s correct depends on what time period we \u2019 re talking about .\nBetween April and July this year , workers are paying a higher rate of NICs ( tax rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase ( effective tax cut ) .\nSo it \u2019 s fair to say that for those three months , most workers will pay more in NICs than before .\nBut across the whole financial year \u2013 April 2022 to April 2023 \u2013 the majority of workers will see their NICs bill fall , thanks to the rise in the threshold .\nStuart Adam , senior economist at the IFS , told FactCheck : \u201c It is not the case that in this tax year as a whole most people will pay more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from April [ 2022 ] onwards , \u201d he added , \u201c most employees and self-employed people will be paying less NICs , not more.\n\u201d In a conversation about the government \u2019 s changes to national insurance , Keir Starmer said that \u201c most families will be much worse off.\n\u201d That may be true for the period April 2022 to July 2022 .\nFor those three months , most workers are paying a higher rate of national insurance ( a tax rise ) and have yet to benefit from an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s slated for the summer ( which will be an effective tax cut ) .\nBut the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies tells FactCheck that across the whole financial year ( April 2022 to April 2023 ) , the majority of workers will pay less national insurance than they did last year .", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url": "https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-starmers-national-insurance-claim", "published": "Wed, 04 May 2022 18:12:03

senior Conservative and Labour figures have been thrashing out an age-old question : which party charges the most council tax ?\nBoris Johnson tweeted today : \u201c Conservative councillors deliver better local services for lower council taxes \u201d , echoed by cabinet colleague Oliver Dowden : \u201c Conservative councils charge the lowest taxes in the country \u201d .\nConservative minister Victoria Atkins said on last night \u2019 s Channel 4 News : \u201c If you look across the board at the cheapest council tax councils in England , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Wes Streeting replied : \u201c On average , council tax in Labour councils is \u00a3329 lower than they are in Conservative authorities \u201d .\nHe suggested the FactCheck team look into it .\nSo here goes .\nHow much council tax you pay depends partly on which of eight \u201c bands \u201d your home falls into .\nThe categories are based on the value of the property in 1991 .\nRight in the middle is Band D \u2013 which is what we often talk about when council tax is on the agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has previously pointed out , the Band D rate only tells us part of the story .\nIt is , after all , based on a 30-year-old system that can \u2019 t keep up with changes in property prices and local demographics .\nA more helpful metric is often the \u201c average council tax per dwelling \u201d ( though as FullFact explains , it is not perfect ) .\nBy both the Band D and the average tax per dwelling measures , it \u2019 s true to say that the two local authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England are indeed led by Conservatives .\n( They \u2019 re Westminster and Wandsworth ) .\nBut it \u2019 s harder to sustain Ms Atkins \u2019 claim that the same is true \u201c across the board \u201d .\nFactCheck analysis of government data finds that Conservatives control five of the top ten cheapest areas by Band D rates , and ten of the top 20 .\nAnd when we rank councils by average tax per dwelling , Conservatives only control two of the cheapest 20 local authorities in England .\nWhat about Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge \u00a3329 less on average than those led by Conservatives ?\nThe figure comes from analysis by the Labour office of the Local Government Association , which used official data from the government .\nFactCheck was able to replicate this finding using the same dataset .\nThe same Labour LGA analysis found Liberal Democrat councils charged the most on average : \u00a31,772 versus \u00a31,642 from the Conservatives and \u00a31,313 from Labour .\nWe understand that the Conservatives prefer to use the Band D measure as , according to the Department for Levelling Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition is widely regarded as a benchmark when comparing council tax levels in different areas or over time.\n\u201d The same publication points out that \u201c Band D has historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities , as this measure is not affected by the varying distribution of properties in bands that can be found across authorities.\n\u201d By this measure , the difference between the two largest parties is more modest \u2013 with Labour councils charging \u00a340 less on average than the Conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that FactCheck has reviewed .\nIt \u2019 s true that the two local authorities in England with the lowest council tax bills are run by Conservatives .\nOn average , council tax \u201c per dwelling \u201d is \u00a3329 lower in Labour-run English councils compared to Conservative local authorities .\nComparing Band D properties , the difference between the two parties is more modest ( \u00a340 ) .\nThat \u2019 s according to Labour-led analysis that FactCheck was able to replicate using official government data .\nThe same

of \u201c indecent assault , sexual assault , rape , abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office , \u201d according to a force spokesman .\n\u201c In January 2020 , the Met received a report relating to alleged sexual offences having been committed between 2002 and 2009 , \u201d he said .\nIn an updated statement released today , the force said the man , who \u2019 s in his fifties

will their identity be released by Parliament , the Conservative party or the police .\nIt used to be that if an MP was arrested , the Commons Speaker would have to tell the House \u2013 either in an oral statement or by \u201c laying \u201d a letter in the House of Commons Library .\nThis meant the arrested member \u2019 s identity quickly became public knowledge .\nBut in 2016 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons Standards Committee .\nThe Speaker is no longer obliged to tell the House of a member \u2019 s arrest , and can only do so if the MP agrees .\nThe Committee \u2019 s rationale was that the previous arrangements were incompatible with a person \u2019 s right to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights and other elements of UK law .\nThey said they wanted to bring the rules around naming an arrested MP in line with standard practice for naming an ordinary member of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that police will only name an arrested person if there \u2019 s an exceptional reason to do so , like a threat to life .\nWhy hasn \u2019 t the Conservative party named the MP ?\nA Conservative party spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday : \u201c The Chief Whip [ who is in charge of party discipline ] has asked that the MP concerned does not attend the Parliamentary Estate while an investigation is ongoing .\nUntil the conclusion of the investigation we will not be commenting further.\n\u201d Why hasn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone \u2019 s been arrested , the rules around what can be published are very strict .\nThe idea is to make sure that if a case ever reaches a court trial , future jurors will not be prejudiced by what they \u2019 ve read or seen in the media .\nIn May 2020 , the Court of Appeal endorsed a previous ruling by the High Court that said , \u201c in general , a person does have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a police investigation up to the point of charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation Bloomberg , which had wanted to report the name of a businessman identified in documents relating to a bribery investigation .\nThe Court of Appeal decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in February 2022 .\nAnd the stakes are high

work?", "content": "That \u2019 s what President Joe Biden said in his address to the nation following the news that a gunman had killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde , Texas .\nBut the state \u2019 s own governor , Greg Abbott \u2013 who told the National Rifle Association after the 2018 Santa Fe school massacre in which ten people died that \u201c the problem is not guns , it \u2019 s hearts without God \u201d \u2013 said in response to the latest shooting that more firearm restrictions are \u201c not a real solution \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s take a look at what we know .\nExactly who \u2019 s allowed to buy and use what type of weapon and under what circumstances varies from state to state \u2013 which can make comparing the overall stringency of different states \u2019 arrangements tricky .\nNo metric is perfect , but we \u2019 re using the Gun Friendly Index , compiled by pro-gun legal organisation , AZ Defenders , which looks at a range of firearms laws in each state .\nThese include whether and how long you have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it home , the extent of background checks you have to undergo , and whether you \u2019 re allowed to openly carry firearms in public .\nUsing this information , combined with their subjective assessment of \u201c strength of gun culture \u201d , AZ Defenders gives every state a score .\nA low mark means the state is \u201c less friendly \u201d to gun owners , while a high score means the state is \u201c more friendly \u201d .\nWe compared these scores with US Center for Disease Control ( CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 including homicides , suicides and accidents .\nMore than 45,000 people died from gun-related injuries that year .\nSome 54 per cent of the deaths were by suicide .\nOur analysis found that states with looser gun rules tend to suffer higher rates of firearm-related deaths per 100,000 people , while those with the toughest regimes saw the lowest death rates .\nWe calculate that the \u201c correlation coefficient \u201d between these two measures is just over 0.7 .\nThat means that a 10 per cent increase in a state \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 7 per cent increase in the firearms death rate , on average .\nThis is normally considered by statisticians to be a strong correlation .\nEach dot on the graph below represents one of the fifty states .\nThe relationship is clearest in those clustered in the bottom left of the graph .\nThe seven states where it \u2019 s hardest to get and legally use a gun ( including New York , California , Massachusetts and Hawaii ) were also the seven states with the lowest firearm death rates .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlation does not equal causation .\nJust because we can draw a line on a graph doesn \u2019 t mean we know that it \u2019 s gun laws driving the difference .\nSo let \u2019 s see if we can go further : can we establish whether any particular policies affect gun deaths ?\nAfter a tragedy like the one that hit Texas in May , we often hear politicians and commentators call for tougher or more broadly applied background checks \u2013 where a person has to pass criminal and mental health records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal ( i.e .\nnational ) law says licensed firearm dealers must carry out background checks on anyone attempting to buy a gun .\nDemocrats in Congress want to expand this to cover private sales \u2013 trades between individuals or at gun shows \u2013 across all 50 states .\nTheir Republican opponents have consistently blocked the legislation .\nA major analysis of thousands of scientific papers carried out by the nonprofit think tank , the Rand Corporation , found \u201c moderate \u201d evidence that the current federally mandated background checks by licensed dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means : \u201c Two or more studies\u2060 \u2013 at least one of which was not compromised by serious methodological weaknesses\u2060 \u2013 found significant effects in the same direction , and contradictory evidence was not found in other studies with equivalent or stronger methods.\n\u201d But they said the evidence was \u201c inconclusive \u201d that background checks for private sales \u2013 which currently operate in some states \u2013 reduce murder rates .\n\u201c Inconclusive \u201d means that studies of similar quality pointed in different directions , or that just one study could be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive \u201d results .\nAnd it would seem that background checks did not stop the Texas elementary school attacker from buying his two assault rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition \u2013 which he did legally from a licensed dealer just days after his eighteenth birthday .\nThis isn \u2019 t surprising as , according to Governor Abbott , the suspect had no criminal record and no known mental health history and so would not have been flagged by a standard background check .\nOn average , 70 American women are shot and killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Everytown , an organisation that campaigns for tougher gun laws .\nAnother activist group , Giffords , puts the figure at 600 a year , or 50 a month .\nAs it stands , federal law prevents someone buying a firearm from a licensed dealer if they \u2019 ve been convicted of domestic violence misdemeanours , or are subject to some types of domestic violence restraining order .\nBut there are gaps in the types of restraining orders that are covered at the federal level .\nAnd the Rand analysis finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill in those gaps \u2013 blocking more abusers from access to guns \u2013 the rate of intimate partner homicides goes down .\nWhat about the link between domestic violence and mass shootings ?\nGiffords says : \u201c In more than half of mass shootings where four or more people were killed , the shooter killed an intimate partner , and one analysis found that nearly a third of mass shooters had a history of domestic violence \u201d .\nThe analysis in question found 28 out of 89 mass shooters over the period 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic violence ( that \u2019 s about a third ) .\nOf those 28 , the researchers found 17 had \u201c been involved with the justice system for domestic violence \u201d , including six who \u2019 d been convicted .\nBut the Rand Corporation , which looked at thousands of research papers published over several decades , found no studies on the relationship between domestic violence restrictions and mass shootings that even met the threshold for inclusion in its analysis .\nEn route to the funeral of a victim of another recent shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president Kamala Harris said on Sunday : \u201c We know what works on this , it includes let \u2019 s have an assault weapon ban \u201d .\nAs in Ulvade , Texas , the alleged Buffalo shooter \u2013 who has been charged with the murder of 10 people in a supermarket in a racially-motivated attack \u2013 purchased an assault rifle legally aged 18 .\nThere \u2019 s no single definition of an assault weapon \u2013 and some pro-gun groups even consider the term controversial \u2013 but in 1994 , the US Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use \u201d .\nThat same year , the Clinton administration banned the making , transfer or possession of semiautomatic weapons nationwide .\nBut the legislation had a built-in expiry date of September 2004 , at which point Clinton \u2019 s successor George W Bush declined to renew the regulations .\nThis presented what scientists sometimes call a natural experiment .\nComparing the times before , during and after the ban could shed light on whether restricting access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHere \u2019 s a graphic from the Financial Times .\nLooking at the time before 1994 and after 2004 , it suggests that mass shootings were less common and less deadly during the federal assault weapons ban than in the periods before or after it was in place .\nA 2019 peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery reaches a similar conclusion : \u201c Mass-shooting related homicides in the United States were reduced during the years of the federal assault weapons ban of 1994 to 2004 \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the research is \u201c observational \u201d \u2013 meaning it can \u2019 t tell us whether it \u2019 s the assault weapons ban that caused the reduction in shootings and deaths .\nThe Rand Corporation \u2019 s assessment of studies that aim to work out if there \u2019 s a causal link between the two found \u201c inconclusive \u201d evidence when it comes to mass shootings and other homicides .\nAnd we should also say that while assault weapons seem to make it easier to kill large numbers of people in a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in 16 per cent of mass shootings \u2013 according to research by Everytown .\nThe group estimates handguns were involved in 81 per cent of mass shootings , and were the only type of weapon used in 60 per cent .\nWe have stronger causal evidence that removing \u201c stand-your-ground \u201d laws \u2013 which currently operate in 34 states \u2013 saves lives .\nHere \u2019 s how the Rand Corporation explains this type of law : \u201c Self-defense has long been available as a criminal defense for fatal and nonfatal confrontations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retreat before using force , if safe retreat is available .\nStand-your-ground laws \u2013 referred to by some as shoot-first laws \u2013 remove this duty to retreat in some cases of self-defense.\n\u201d The Rand analysis finds \u201c supportive \u201d evidence that stand-your-ground laws increase firearms homicides .\nThis is the most powerful ranking the analysts award and means that three or more high-quality studies found the policy had \u201c suggestive or significant effects in the same direction using at least two independent data sets \u201d .\nAnd as the Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gun deaths ] aren \u2019 t simply from \u2018 bad guys \u2019 getting shot ; the research [ as analysed by the Rand Corporation ] shows the additional deaths created by stand-your-ground laws far surpass the documented cases of defensive gun use in the United States.\n\u201d In other words , the research suggests people are more likely to commit murder \u2013 not just kill an attacker in self-defence \u2013 if they live in a state that provides a strong legal protection for the person who shoots first .\nChild-access prevention laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c allow prosecutors to bring charges against adults who intentionally or carelessly allow children to have unsupervised access to firearms \u201d says Rand .\nIts analysis found \u201c supportive \u201d evidence that such policies reduce suicide and accidental deaths .\nWhy don \u2019 t we know more ?\nIt might be surprising to learn that a topic of such significance \u2013 and one that attracts so many academic researchers \u2013 is relatively light on definitive evidence .\nShouldn \u2019 t it be clear by now whether or not high-profile measures like banning assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fewer deaths ?\nBut we have to remember that gun deaths and gun policies do not exist in a vacuum .\nThere are thousands of potential confounding variables \u2013 like poverty , attitudes to firearms , the overall prevalence and nature of violence , the ease with which people can acquire weapons illegally \u2013 that can all interfere with our ability to isolate the cause of gun deaths in a state or city .\nAnd it \u2019 s even been suggested that some academic studies that appear to investigate the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outset to \u201c find nothing \u201d .\nThat \u2019 s the claim of one Harvard professor \u2013 David Hemenway , head of the university \u2019 s Injury Control Research Center \u2013 who analysed two papers that seemed to show that guns had no effect on death rates in the US and Australia .\nProf Hemenway argued that these findings were inevitable \u2013 not because the firearms truly had no effect , but because of the way the studies were designed .\nWhat about an outright ban ?\nSo far we \u2019 ve considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns in the US .\nBut even measures that sound stringent to American ears are underpinned by the assumption that civilians will still be allowed access to firearms \u2013 with the only question being how easy or hard legislators choose to make it .\nThat \u2019 s because the second amendment to the US constitution \u2013 the right to bear arms \u2013 makes it almost impossible for states or the federal government to block citizens \u2019 access to guns altogether .\nAnd it doesn \u2019 t look like this will change any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overturn a constitutional amendment , but it requires support of a \u201c supermajority \u201d in Congress \u2013 more than two thirds of Senators and House Representatives \u2013 plus the agreement of 38 of the 50 states .\nPolitically , this would be challenging to say the least .\nAs one legal commentator wrote in 2018 , \u201c even relatively popular ideas with a big head of steam can hit the wall of the amendment process .\nHow much more challenging would it be to tackle individual gun ownership in a country where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care passionately about their right to do so ?\n\u201d But let \u2019 s imagine for a second that somehow the second amendment was repealed and the federal government had much greater powers to ban or remove guns in the US .\nWhat might we expect ?\nIn 1996 , the Australian government banned handguns and bought back over 600,000 weapons from the public after a massacre left 35 people dead in Port Arthur , Tasmania .\nBefore then , there had been a number of mass shootings in the country , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smaller population , Australia \u2019 s annual mass shooting death toll was not that much lower than the US \u2019 s \u2013 and in some years , like 1987 , even surpassed it .\nBut since the 1996 ban and buyback , 12 people have died in Australian mass shootings , compared to 827 in the US ( these figures go up to 2021 and so do not include the Buffalo and Uvalde massacres ) .\nThis suggests at least a correlation between banning handguns ( which as we \u2019 ve seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American mass shootings ) and a reduction in the number of mass shooting deaths .\nAustralia also saw a fall in overall homicide rates after 1996 .\nBut again , the question arises : was this caused by the ban and buyback policy , or merely a continuation of earlier declines ?\nThe Rand Corporation has looked into this too .\nIts analysis concludes that \u201c only one study [ \u2026 ] provides convincing statistically significant evidence that firearm homicides changed after implementation \u201d .\n\u201c Specifically , \u201d it continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in female firearm homicide victimization \u201d ( women being murdered with guns ) .\nIt also cautions that there is no parallel universe in which Australia did not implement the policy to use as a comparison with reality .\nThis lack of the \u201c counterfactual \u201d or \u201c road not taken \u201d scenario is a common problem for scientists across many disciplines , including those looking at gun control \u2013 and goes some way to explain why the evidence base has so many gaps .\nStates with tougher gun laws have lower firearms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFactCheck analysis using available , if imperfect , metrics suggests that the relationship between the two is strong .\nWe estimate that a 10 per cent increase in a state \u2019 s \u201c Gun Friendly \u201d score , as measured by one pro-gun organisation , is associated with a 7 per cent rise in gun death rates in the state .\nBut we should be clear : this is a correlation , not proof that one caused the other .\nAnd the evidence that high-profile proposals to expand background checks to private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths is surprisingly hazy , according to a major analysis that looked at thousands of research papers .\nThat said , the same report found \u201c moderate \u201d evidence that some gun control measures can reduce homicides \u2013 for example , expanding background checks to cover more domestic abusers .\nAnd it revealed stronger evidence still that removing \u201c stand your ground \u201d laws and restricting children \u2019 s accidental access to firearms does save lives .", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url": "https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-does-gun-control-work", "published": "Mon, 30 May 2022

system reduce boat crossings?", "content": "That \u2019 s the claim from the UK Home Office factsheet on the government \u2019 s plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda .\nThe UK policy is that \u201c every person who comes to the UK illegally , or by dangerous or unnecessary methods from safe countries \u2013 including those arriving by small boats , hidden in the back of lorries and found in the UK without leave \u2013 will be considered for relocation to Rwanda.\n\u201d So , did the Australian offshore asylum system reduce dangerous sea crossings ?\nLike the UK , Australia has a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persecution \u2013 attempting to reach the country unofficially by boat .\nThe term \u201c asylum seeker \u201d refers to someone who is asking for safety in another country .\nIf they are granted asylum , they are given refugee status .\nUnder normal circumstances , whether someone receives that status is up to the country they \u2019 ve arrived in .\nOffshore processing is when asylum seekers are sent to another nation to have their claims heard .\nIn September 2012 , the Australian government restarted a policy that had previously been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending some people who came to the country by sea for asylum processing in Papua New Guinea and Nauru .\nIn July 2013 , newly re-elected prime minister Kevin Rudd expanded the scheme to everyone reaching the country by unofficial boat and declared that no-one who arrived by this route would ever be allowed to resettle in Australia .\nAt first glance , the answer appears to be yes .\nThe number of people arriving by boat on Australian shores is now significantly lower than it was in the years before offshoring was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture is less clear .\nIn the year after offshore processing began , the number of arrivals did not decline \u2013 it increased .\nSome 25,173 people arrived by boat between July 2012 and July 2013 \u2013 three times more than the number who crossed in the previous 12 months .\n( We \u2019 re using the Australian Library of Parliament \u2019 s July to July figures as this is the structure of the Australian financial year ) .\nIt \u2019 s only in 2014 that we start to see a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of maritime arrivals was 157 .\nThe following year , it was zero .\nIt \u2019 s hard to say for certain what brought this about , but one possibility is the \u2018 turnback \u2019 and \u2018 takeback \u2019 policies .\nThe Australian military began escorting small boats to the edge of its territorial waters ( turnbacks ) , and the authorities started working with other nations to return people who \u2019 d reached Australian shores ( takebacks ) .\nThe first turnbacks \u2013 part of Operation Sovereign Borders \u2013 began on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely with the drop in boat arrivals than the introduction of the offshoring policy in 2012 .\nAnd it \u2019 s not just the number of people reaching Australia by boat that fell \u2013 FactCheck analysis of Australian Library of Parliament data shows the number of people attempting the crossing declined significantly too after 2014 .\n( Although we should say that this dataset may undercount the true number of people attempting the crossing ) .\nThis is important because part of the stated rationale for the policy was to deter people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place .\n( Though as this expert testimony to the UK parliament notes , the practice of escorting boats out of Australian waters is hardly risk-free for asylum seekers ) .\nYou might be thinking : could the decline in boat arrivals be thanks to Kevin Rudd \u2019 s toughening of the offshore regime in July 2013 ?\nAgain , it \u2019 s hard to say .\nMadeline Gleeson , senior research fellow at the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at UNSW Sydney , tells FactCheck that the short time between that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents a straightforward line of causation to the drop in boat arrival numbers.\n\u201d In other words , we can \u2019 t separate out which policy was the true cause .\n\u201c However , \u201d she says , \u201c there are other persuasive indications that the resettlement issue [ i.e .\nthe toughening of offshoring ] on its own was not a deterrent.\n\u201d Using official figures , Ms Gleeson and her colleagues found that 1,241 people either reached Australia or were turned back between September and December 2013 .\nAt this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughened , but the policy of turnbacks and takebacks was not yet fully operational .\nIf it was the offshore toughening that caused the decline , we \u2019 d expect to see a major fall during that period .\nIn fact , more people reached or attempted to reach Australia in those three months than made the journey in the whole of 2014 .\nThis further suggests that turnbacks and takebacks were more important than the offshore regime .\nBut we should be clear that even this correlation is not proof that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline in numbers .\nAndreas Schloenhardt , professor of criminal law at the University of Queensland , told FactCheck to \u201c keep in mind that the Australian Government implemented a suite of measures , which makes it difficult to point to the specific effect of any one of them.\n\u201d So , we have some possible alternative explanations for the decline in boat arrivals , though none of them are proven .\nBut let \u2019 s take a step back .\nIt \u2019 s for the UK government to demonstrate that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in people crossing by boat is correct .\nTo do that , it would have to show a correlation between the two events ( boat crossings fell after the policy was introduced ) and that other plausible explanations had been ruled out .\nThe evidence that the two events are correlated is , as we \u2019 ve seen , patchy .\nAnd there are other explanations \u2013 like the introduction of turnbacks \u2013 that have not been ruled out and are more closely correlated with the fall in boat arrivals .\nProf Schloenhardt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the UK government \u2019 s assertion is \u201c overly simplistic \u201d and \u201c ignores that a myriad of measures and other factors were ( and always will be ) at play.\n\u201d What lessons for the UK ?\nUnlike the Australian scheme , people sent to Rwanda by the UK government would not be detained there .\nOnce they arrive , they are free to leave or to seek asylum in the country .\nThe government says : \u201c People will have all their needs looked after while their asylum claims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those relocated will be given a generous support package , including up to five years of training , accommodation and healthcare.\n\u201d This may help avoid a repetition of the many documented problems caused by Australia \u2019 s detention centres .\nThe regime has seen hundreds of people \u2013 including children \u2013 detained for a year on average in overcrowded and unhygienic detention centres in partner countries .\nSome people have been trapped in the centres for years .\nStill , critics of the UK scheme have raised concerns that Rwanda \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with a large volume of applications and warn that some of those taken to the country could be traumatised by the experience .\nThe Home Office was keen to stress the differences between the UK and Australian schemes and disputed the suggestion that the UK \u2019 s Rwanda policy constitutes asylum offshoring , arguing instead that it is a \u201c migration and economic partnership \u201d .\nWe put it to the Home Office that it was incorrect to say that Australia \u2019 s arrangements with Papua New Guinea and Nauru caused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn \u2019 t clear , and the turnback and takeback policy seemed a more likely explanation .\nA spokesperson told FactCheck : \u201c We do not accept these claims at all .\nOur world-leading partnership with Rwanda is a fundamental part of our strategy , underpinned by measures in the Nationality and Borders Act , to overhaul the broken asylum system and drive down illegal migration.\n\u201d In a factsheet on the UK policy to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda , the government says \u201c the Australians have agreements with Papua New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegally for processing .\nThis was successful in reducing illegal maritime arrivals.\n\u201d But the evidence that asylum offshoring caused the reduction in boat arrivals is patchy .\nOne alternative explanation could be the Australian military \u2019 s policy of turning back unofficial boats , which began in December 2013 .\nExperts warn that it is difficult to measure the effects of any individual scheme as Australia introduced several asylum policies within months of each other .", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url":

the problem goes wider than just one party .\nA special investigation by Channel 4 News reveals the shocking scale of sexual harassment and bullying in Westminster \u2013 and the claims by some staff members that systems designed to protect them are actually making their lives harder .\nMore than one in ten staff working for MPs across Westminster that we surveyed said they have been sexually harassed , Channel 4 News can reveal , and 51 % said that a colleague has confided in them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel 4 News has uncovered claims of widespread bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons .\nWe heard from 51 staffers from political parties across Westminster about sexual harassment .\nA quarter of them told us that they had witnessed sexual harassment taking place .\nSpeaking anonymously to Channel 4 News , one staff member said , \u201c I \u2019 ve seen an MP and a staff member in the bar , the MP grabbing them , holding them .\nI could see the staff member looking visibly uncomfortable.\n\u201d Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really bad experience .\nHer boss was threatening her , saying \u2018 if you don \u2019 t perform this sexual favour , you won \u2019 t progress in your career.\n\u2019 \u201d Earlier this year , SNP MP Patrick Grady was found by parliament \u2019 s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme to have sexually harassed a male member of staff .\nHe had to give a public apology in the House of Commons and was suspended for two days .\nEight other allegations against him were dismissed .\nHis victim spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told Cathy Newman , \u201c Patrick Grady came over and started putting his fingers down the back of my neck .\nIt was quite forceful .\nHe was also grabbing and caressing my arm and stroking my lower back.\n\u201d When he reported the incident to the complaints service and SNP officials , he told us , \u201c I was cut out of meetings\u2026 MPs and staff members gave me the silent treatment .\nIt felt like they were just turning against me and closing ranks.\n\u201d \u201c I am aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re scared of losing their jobs , and I \u2019 m living proof of that.\n\u201d He said , \u201c to go through a process for that long and to give quite a weak sanction \u2013 in my view \u2013 of two days , tells me that the [ parliamentary complaints systems ] think it \u2019 s okay for members of parliament to sexually harass staff as long as they \u2019 re a little bit sorry for it.\n\u201d The police have said there will be no action on the Patrick Grady case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The SNP takes all complaints seriously and the parliamentary group fully accepted and implemented the recommendations of the ICGS .\nThe individual concerned has been offered support , and we have sought to meet to discuss their concerns .\nWe have also initiated a review of staff support to consider any improvements that could be made.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s not only sexual harassment that is blighting the UK parliament : bullying of MPs \u2019 staff is not uncommon .\nHalf of the 42 current and former staff members we spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of it .\nOne male staffer told us , \u201c The job shattered my self-confidence in a really horrible way .\nIt \u2019 s taken almost three years for me to approach something feeling normal.\n\u201d Another said that there are MPs that are informally \u201c blacklisted \u201d among parliamentary staff due to their high turnover in their offices .\n\u201c The horror stories\u2026are so frequent .\nI would never recommend to a friend to interview with them \u201d , he told us .\nJenny Symmons , the GMB Union representative in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff member herself , told Cathy Newman , \u201c bullying is a lot more tolerated and accepted and happens in various different ways in a lot of offices , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Through the GMB Union in Parliament we help staff every week with various cases of bullying.\n\u201d \u201c I think that when politicians try and say that there are a few bad apples , I really resoundingly condemn that .\nIt \u2019 s not a case of a few bad apples .\nI do think it \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with it ?\nDavid Barker took his boss , Labour MP Liam Byrne , to the complaints service claiming that he was bullied but found he ended up suffering more as a result .\nHis complaint took two years to be investigated , and in that time his mental health deteriorated .\nHe told us he didn \u2019 t feel like he was being protected by the process .\n\u201c In no functioning business would it take nearly two years to interview a handful of people , \u201d he told Channel 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI just felt terrible that all I was able to get for two years of my life was two days off work for him.\n\u201d Six allegations of bullying against Liam Byrne MP were dismissed , but one was upheld .\nThe commissioner concluded that it \u201c was malicious behaviour that involved a significant misuse of power \u201d .\nWitnesses who gave evidence in David \u2019 s case were promised anonymity by the complaints service , but that was breached .\nTheir unredacted names and statements were sent directly to the MP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those witnesses , who wanted to remain anonymous .\nHe told us , \u201c we \u2019 ve all suffered as a result of it , and our careers in politics have suffered.\n\u201d According to an exclusive survey conducted by Channel 4 News , nearly three-quarters ( 71 % ) of staff members in Westminster we spoke to said they felt speaking out about sexual harassment or bullying would harm their careers .\n59 % told us that there was no culture of speaking out in Westminster .\nLiam Byrne MP had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c genuine remorse \u201d and was also suspended from

Budget Responsibility ( OBR ) said that the then-chancellor Rishi Sunak had \u00a330bn of \u201c fiscal headroom \u201d to play with .\nThat \u2019 s cash he could use on public spending or tax cuts without breaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use this headroom , citing the OBR \u2019 s warning that it could be \u201c wiped out by relatively small changes to the economic outlook , \u201d such as lower-than-expected growth or high-than-expected inflation .\nIt \u2019 s that \u00a330bn that Ms Truss seems to have earmarked for her own policies .\nHow much do Truss \u2019 plans cost ?\nInterviewer Nick Robinson put it to the foreign secretary that her proposals would cost the Exchequer \u00a338bn a year .\nShe said the figure was \u201c slightly high but it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) think tank said on Thursday that Ms Truss \u2019 tax cuts alone would \u201c cost more than \u00a330bn \u2013 possibly considerably more , \u201d depending on the precise details .\nAdd to that a key spending commitment : to increase defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP by 2030 .\nThe IFS estimates this could cost \u00a323bn a year by 2030 .\nTaken together , it looks like Ms Truss has committed to rather more than \u00a330bn a year .\nSo even if the headroom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and have to borrow money ( thereby breaking a current fiscal rule ) or have to make spending cuts elsewhere .\nAnd there \u2019 s another catch : there \u2019 s no guarantee that all of that \u00a330bn spare cash is still there .\nAs IFS boss Paul Johnson points out , the headroom estimate was made at a time when inflation was expected to be a mere 4 per cent .\nWe now know it \u2019 s much higher than that .\nWhile inflation increases the amount of tax revenue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it also increases the amount it has to spend on public services ( money going out ) .\nSo there may well be less in the pot than previously thought .\nThe IFS reiterates the OBR \u2019 s warning from April : estimates of fiscal headroom , it says , suffer from a \u201c huge amount of uncertainty \u201d .\nLiz Truss says her tax and spending policies will not break \u201c current fiscal rules \u201d .\nShe has pledged tax cuts that will cost \u201c more than \u00a330bn \u201d according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) .\nShe seems to be focusing on the \u00a330bn figure as this is the amount of \u201c fiscal headroom \u201d the UK had in April .\nThat is , spare cash that could be spent on tax cuts or spending increases without breaking the current rules .\nBut she \u2019 s also made spending commitments that could cost \u00a323bn a year by 2030 , according to the IFS .\nIf those estimates are right then , taken together , her plans would be well in excess of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a further catch : the \u00a330bn of spare cash may not even be there any more because inflation has risen faster than was expected at the time the headroom estimate was made .\nThe IFS says that \u201c without spending reductions , [ Ms Truss \u2019 ] tax promises would likely lead to the current fiscal rules being broken \u201d .", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url":

"The average household in England , Scotland and Wales will spend more than \u00a33,000 a year on energy from October 2022 , according to market researchers at Cornwall Insight .\nAnalysts at another firm , BFY Group , predict that annual bills could soar to nearly \u00a34,000 \u2013 reaching \u00a3500 next January alone .\nAs recently as October 2021 , a typical home was paying \u00a31,370 a year .\nIf the latest estimates materialise this winter , that means energy bills will have more than doubled in 12 months .\nSo , what \u2019 s behind this sudden increase ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame ?\nLet \u2019 s take a look .\nHow does the price cap work ?\nOfgem sets a \u201c cap \u201d which limits the maximum amount that 15 million domestic energy customers in Great Britain will pay .\n( Northern Ireland has its own regulator , which operates a broadly similar system on certain tariffs . )\nThe cap doesn \u2019 t cover people on fixed-term energy contracts as Ofgem says \u201c these are more likely to be good value.\n\u201d The level of the cap is set every six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c reflect the estimated costs to supply energy \u201d over the next half-year .\nDeciding what the price cap should be is a fine balancing act for the regulator .\nSet it too low and energy providers could go bust because they can \u2019 t cover their costs , which reduces supply and drives up prices .\nSet it too high and consumers could be plunged into poverty , and even face life-threatening cold .\nThe World Health Organization cites one study that estimates cold homes could be responsible for 38,000 deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ofgem says , \u201c Capped prices only increase when the underlying cost of energy increases .\nEqually , if costs fall consumers should see a cut in their bills as suppliers are prevented from keeping prices higher for longer than necessary.\n\u201d Recent price cap rises are mainly the result of huge increases in the wholesale cost of gas \u2013 i.e .\nthe price energy suppliers are paying to buy gas on the world market .\nThis is in turn driven by a \u201c perfect storm \u201d of problems , according to analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an independent research centre that \u2019 s affiliated to the University of Oxford .\nTheir analysis describes how , in 2019 , gas prices were actually expected to fall in the years ahead .\nExperts were anticipating more supplies of liquified natural gas ( LNG ) reaching Europe and only a small growth in demand for gas .\nIf those predictions had come true , we might now be seeing our energy bills come down .\nBut , in reality , the opposite happened .\nDemand for gas surged thanks to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher-than-expected gas use in China as the country recovered from Covid .\nMeanwhile , Europe didn \u2019 t receive as much LNG as had been expected because demand from the rest of the world meant there was less to go around .\nAnd since the Oxford Institute analysis was published in 2021 , there \u2019 s been a further problem : Vladimir Putin \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine .\nThis has affected the EU directly , as Russia provided 40 per cent of the bloc \u2019 s gas in 2021 .\n( Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reliance on Russian imports , but the transition could take some time . )\nYou might think that we \u2019 d be insulated against this as , even before the war , only 4 per cent of our gas came from Russia .\nBut the invasion has further driven up the global gas price , as traders worry that it might become harder to get hold of Russian supplies in future , which has turbocharged the rise in UK energy bills .\nSo that \u2019 s why the wholesale price of gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers in Great Britain aren \u2019 t fending for themselves on the energy high seas \u2013 we have a regulator whose job is to \u201c protect energy consumers , especially vulnerable people , by ensuring they are treated fairly and benefit from a cleaner , greener environment.\n\u201d The National Audit Office ( NAO ) said in June that , while \u201c Ofgem could not have prevented the increase in wholesale prices in 2021 from significantly affecting \u201d customers , \u201c it did not do enough in the years that preceded it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to external shocks.\n\u201d The watchdog believes that Ofgem allowed too many financially unstable suppliers to enter the market .\nWhen wholesale prices rose , those companies couldn \u2019 t cope with the massive hit to their bottom line and folded .\nThe House of Commons Business Committee made a similar observation last month .\nIts report \u201c found overwhelming consensus that the collapse of 29 energy retailers between July 2021 and May 2022 could have been mitigated through robust regulation of suppliers.\n\u201d The collapse of those firms has pushed up prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers who had to switch suppliers paid on average \u00a330 more a month as a result .\nThat \u2019 s on top of the hikes caused by wholesale gas prices .\nResponding to the Committee report , Ofgem said : \u201c No regulator can , or should , guarantee companies will not fail in a competitive market but we are working hard to reform the entire market , as well as closely scrutinising and holding individual energy suppliers to account , to further strengthen the regulatory regime.\n\u201d Energy bills in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons .\nThe price that energy suppliers pay for gas on the world commodity markets has shot up since 2021 thanks to a \u201c perfect storm \u201d of lower-than-expected supply and higher-than-expected demand for gas .\nThis was exacerbated by Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year .\nOn top of that , British consumers who had to move from failed suppliers are paying \u00a330 a month more because so many energy providers have gone out of business , according to Citizens Advice .\nTwo major watchdogs say this reflects a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the market that weren \u2019 t financially stable enough to cope with hikes in global gas prices .\nOfgem says it \u2019 s tightening its rules to reduce the risk of this happening in future .", "author": "Georgina

on 1 November 2019 .\nHis final hours were captured on police bodycam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked \u201c multiple times \u201d where it was , according to official documents , and when paramedics did arrive , Mr Gill , who had a history of seizures , was not assessed as a medical emergency .\nMr Gill later had a fourth seizure in the back of the ambulance and was only seen by a doctor after his fifth

\u201d gesture with his hands to describe Mr Gill \u2019 s condition during a conversation with a colleague .\nThe paramedic in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tucking in his shirt .\nA coroner recently found Mr Gill \u2019 s arrest \u201c unduly influenced the assessment of urgency \u201d by paramedics .\nMr Gill \u2019 s mother Karen Bond told Channel 4 News : \u201c When it is your child and he is in that position , you just think people are not seeing his pain and I felt like no-one reacted quick enough to say : this is urgent , this could be a life-threatening situation.\n\u201d She also alleged paramedics \u201c looked at him like a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested and this \u201c scarred their thoughts about how to treat him \u201d .\nSenior figures at London Ambulance Service have

.\nEmily Anning , the mother of Mr Gill \u2019 s young son , said Mr Gill was treated \u201c like a nobody \u201d .\n\u201c It was just awful to see , \u201d she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him , thinking he was pretending to have seizures and even if they thought he was lying , they should have treated him as if he wasn \u2019 t \u2013 that is their job and that is what they are trained to do and they didn \u2019 t. \u201d Mr Gill \u2019 s cause of death was listed as multiple seizures and cocaine taken alongside prescription medication .\nHowever , an inquest jury expressed concerns over the impact of delays from the outset on Mr Gill \u2019 s chances of survival .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deaths report , issued by Coroner Jonathan Landau , identified several \u201c matters of concern \u201d including a failure to transfer Mr Gill to hospital under blue lights and sirens .\nThe report also raised concerns that the most senior clinician drove the ambulance and was not on hand to provide treatment which a colleague was \u201c unqualified to provide \u201d , and also flagged concerns about the 96-minute stay in the hospital waiting room before being seen by a doctor .\nMr Landau concluded : \u201c Whilst it was reasonable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link between the arrest and seizures , the arrest unduly influenced the assessment of urgency.\n\u201d Lewisham Hospital and London Ambulance Service have pledged to learn lessons from Raphael Gill \u2019 s case , promising improvements to handover procedures and the issuing of fresh clinical guidance .\nDr Fenella Wrigley , chief medical officer at London Ambulance Service , expressed \u201c sincerest condolences \u201d to Mr Gill \u2019 s family , adding she was sorry if they felt parts of his care could have been handled more sensitively .\nShe said : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coroner \u2019 s recommendations following the inquest into Mr Gill \u2019 s death .\nAs a result , we are reviewing and re-issuing several pieces

monthly energy bills?", "date": "2022-09-05", "source": "channel4uk", "title": "FactCheck: does working from home really add hundreds to monthly energy bills?", "content": "How much does working from home add to your energy bills ?\nEarly in August , MailOnline reported that those working from home could end up paying an additional \u00a3139 for the privilege in November , rising to \u00a3142 in December and \u00a3191 in January .\nOn 31 August , the Telegraph said that home workers will pay \u00a3209 more a month , which it claimed would \u201c kill the work from home dream \u201d .\nAnd on the same day , Sky News published an article on its rolling news page which put the monthly figure at \u00a3131 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ how does it stack up against commuting costs ?\nDo the numbers add up ?\nAll of these stories are based on analyses by the energy comparison company , Uswitch .\nAs some of them note , Uswitch says that someone working from home will use 75 per cent more gas and 25 per cent more electricity than a person who works out of the home .\nWe asked Uswitch why it assumed this in its calculations .\nUswitch told us that it expected people working from home would have their central heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who went out to work would only use it for 14 hours .\nThat \u2019 s a difference of 71 per cent , which Uswitch said it rounded up to 75 per cent to account for additional hot water use .\nBut is it really the case that the average household has the central heating on for the entire time there \u2019 s someone at home ?\nUswitch was unable to provide us with any data to back up this claim .\nAnd we \u2019 ve found figures that point in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government survey of household heating use , homes where everyone is working away from home during the week have the central heating on for 6 hours a day on average during the winter .\nIn households where someone is in all day ( which includes home workers ) , the figure is 8.5 hours .\nCombined with weekend heating ( 8 hours a day according to these stats ) , that means the average full time home worker uses 58.5 hours of central heating a week , compared to 46 hours if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a difference of 21 per cent \u2013 not 75 per cent as Uswitch has assumed .\nCan we put a figure on it ?\nWe think a better approach is to calculate the cost of that extra 12.5 hours \u2019 heating each week .\nFactCheck spoke to Jerry Whiteley , technical manager at the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering .\nHe explained that a boiler will use a lot of energy when it \u2019 s first switched on , but once the target temperature is reached , it will tick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Whiteley gave the example of a 12kwh boiler , which he said you might find in a standard semi detached house .\nHe estimated that the \u201c ticking along \u201d rate for a 12kwh boiler might be 2 to 3kwh , though said the exact figure would depend on many factors , including how well insulated the home is .\nRob Bennett , technical service manager at Pimlico Plumbers , told FactCheck : \u201c It really is a grey area as it depends on the brand of the boiler also .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say that the 12kw boiler will modulate down to 4kw when it has reached its operating temperature.\n\u201d So we tentatively estimate that , for someone with a 12kwh boiler , having the heating on for an extra 2.5 hours would add about \u00a31.50 a day to gas bills \u2013 or \u00a330 a month \u2013 from October .\nAssuming someone working from home runs a laptop for 8 hours , boils the kettle four times and uses the microwave once during the workday , we estimate they \u2019 d add 85p a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their energy bills from October .\n( We \u2019 ve calculated this using figures from the Centre for Sustainable Energy . )\nHow do the bills stack up ?\nEvery household will be different , and there \u2019 s no reliable way to accurately predict how much extra energy the average home worker will use this winter .\nBut , based on the evidence we \u2019 ve seen , we estimate that between October and December , someone working from home can expect to add around \u00a350 a month to their energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the figures quoted in many recent news articles .\nAnd for many , it \u2019 ll be lower than the cost of commuting .\nThe average UK worker spends \u00a366.31 a month getting to work , according to figures compiled by Lloyd \u2019 s Bank in 2019 .\nThe same research found that it \u2019 s even worse in the East of England ( \u00a378.93 a month ) and London ( \u00a376.49 ) .\nThough workers in the East Midlands may find it \u2019 s a harder call \u2013 average commutes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news outlets have run stories claiming that working from home full time could add well over a hundred pounds to monthly energy bills this winter .\nBut FactCheck has questions about the way these figures were calculated by the energy comparison site , Uswitch .\nUsing the limited evidence available , we tentatively estimate that working from home would add about \u00a350 a month to energy bills between October and December \u2013 though the precise amount will depend on a range of factors .\nIf our calculations are right , workers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra energy bills are still lower than the cost of commuting to work .\nA Uswitch.com spokesperson told FactCheck : \u201c During the energy crisis we have done our best to explain to consumers how soaring wholesale costs affect household bills , and it is indisputable that the cost of working from home is rising .\n\u201d", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url": "https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-does-working-from-home-really-add-hundreds-to-monthly-energy-bills", "published": "Mon,

.\nMs Truss \u2019 claim today came in response to criticism from Labour that she intends to cancel a planned increase in corporation tax that had been slated for next year .\nIt \u2019 s true that the total amount of money the government took in from corporation tax rose after the government cut the headline rate from 20 to 19 per cent in 2017 .\nBut is the cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extra cash , as Ms Truss seems to suggest ?\nThe independent Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) says otherwise : \u201c Corporation tax revenue has increased since 2010 even while the headline rate has been cut .\nBut that does not mean that rate reductions have increased revenue.\n\u201d Stuart Adam of the IFS explained to FactCheck that there were other factors in play .\nOne is what economists call \u201c base broadening \u201d \u2013 the government made a series of changes that meant more businesses were taxed and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation tax .\nAnother factor is that during the 2010s , the economy was emerging from the 2008 financial crisis .\nSo , even if the headline rate hadn \u2019 t been cut , we \u2019 d still expect the government to take in more corporation tax revenue simply because businesses were doing better and making more taxable profits .\nAnd it \u2019 s worth saying that while the headline rate of corporation tax was cut , other types of corporation tax saw rates increase over the period the prime minister \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s hardly surprising that corporation tax revenues rose .\nLiz Truss suggested that corporation tax revenues rose because the government had cut the headline rate , which it did in 2017 .\nBut , according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies , other factors explain the increase in revenues over that time .", "author":

Miliband not telling the whole story on energy windfall tax", "content": "That \u2019 s what the shadow business secretary Ed Miliband tweeted last week .\nThe government is freezing the energy cap at its current level , rather than allowing it to rise in October as planned .\nYour total bill depends on your energy use , but the typical home can now expect to pay \u00a32,500 a year from next month \u2013 around \u00a31,000 less than previously expected .\nWe don \u2019 t yet know how much it will cost the public purse , but the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the bill could \u201c easily \u201d reach \u00a3100bn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come \u201d in the second year of the policy ( for context , the pandemic furlough scheme cost \u00a370bn ) .\nLiz Truss \u2019 administration plans to pay for it by borrowing more money \u2013 rather than cutting spending or raising taxes \u2013 and adding to the national debt .\nAgainst this backdrop , Mr Miliband \u2019 s post has been shared thousands of times on social media .\nIt looks like the claim that \u201c oil and gas giants \u201d are \u201c making \u00a3170bn in excess profits \u201d comes from a Bloomberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , the Treasury privately expects UK energy producers could make up to \u00a3170bn more over the next two years than they would have , had Russia not invaded Ukraine and driven up international gas prices .\nBut Bloomberg also reports that \u201c the Treasury said it did not recognise the figures \u201d .\nAnd we can \u2019 t independently verify the number either .\nIndeed , the day after his tweet , Mr Miliband acknowledged in Parliament that the figure is not confirmed .\nHe told the Commons : \u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure of \u00a3170 billion in excess profits .\n[ \u2026 ] If it is not \u00a3170 billion \u2013 we have it on good authority that it is \u2013 the estimates should be published so that we can all see them for ourselves.\n\u201d Reading Mr Miliband \u2019 s tweet , you \u2019 d be forgiven for thinking that oil and gas producers are not currently subject to a windfall tax .\nIn fact , Boris Johnson \u2019 s government introduced one in May this year .\nAnd it taxes energy producers \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , than Labour had proposed at the time : 10 per cent .\nWith the current regime in place , profits on North Sea oil and gas are now taxed at 65 per cent .\nAnd while it \u2019 s true that Liz Truss has publicly expressed her opposition in principle to windfall taxes , she does intend to keep the existing levy in place .\nLabour \u2019 s plan would cover a fraction of the cost of energy bill support Where the new Prime Minister and Labour disagree is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help pay for the government \u2019 s energy support .\nThe opposition party wants to back-date the levy to January , and to remove the tax break on companies \u2019 investment spending .\nIf Labour \u2019 s proposals were enacted , extending the windfall tax would bring in \u00a38bn , according to the party \u2019 s own estimates .\nThat would cover a fraction of the \u00a3100bn required to fund the government \u2019 s energy plan this year .\nMr Miliband writes that instead of a windfall tax ( or rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gas producers , Liz Truss \u201c wants the British people to foot the entire bill for her energy package \u201d .\nYou might think that means oil and gas producers will not be funding any of the government \u2019 s energy support package .\nBut those companies pay taxes , including the existing windfall tax , and will continue to do so .\nThe revenues raised by these taxes , alongside personal taxes like income tax paid by ordinary Brits , will contribute to paying off the extra government debt incurred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s fair to say Ms Truss \u201c wants the British people to foot the entire bill \u201d .\nThe Labour party was contacted for comment .", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url":

claims \u201850 times more\u2019 long A&E waits in England than Scotland", "content": "Nicola Sturgeon faced questions in the Scottish Parliament on her government \u2019 s handling of the NHS on Thursday .\nHer opponent , Conservative Douglass Ross , told MSPs that one patient had waited 84 hours in accident and emergency , which he said his party had discovered through a Freedom of Information request .\nThe First Minister conceded that Scottish A & E performance is \u201c not good enough \u201d , but went on to claim that : The Scottish government pointed FactCheck to NHS stats , which show that 945,072 people waited more than 12 hours in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s 48 times larger than the figure for Scotland ( 19,667 ) \u2013 which is the basis of Ms Sturgeon

.\nThat \u2019 s crucial because Scotland \u2019 s population is much smaller than England \u2019 s .\nEven if the two nations were suffering from this problem to the same extent , England would still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s bigger .\nSo what happens when we do a like-for-like comparison ?\nWhen we first approached them , the Scottish government told FactCheck that \u201c an additional analysis would be that per head of population the number of 12 hour waiters in England is 4.6 times higher than in Scotland \u201d .\nAnd when we look at the proportion of people turning up at A & E who have to wait over 12 hours , we see the rate of these long waits is 3.8 times higher in England than Scotland .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5 per cent in Scotland . )\n\u201c As the First Minister set out , the number of 12 hour waits in England was around 50 times higher than in Scotland , which is in the context of England being around 10.4 times larger in population than Scotland .\nAs a result it can also be expressed that , per head of population , 12 hours waits in England are proportionately 4.6 times worse in England than in Scotland .\n\u201c These different expressions of the relative position between England and Scotland are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Nicola Sturgeon claimed that \u201c 12 hour waits are 50 times more in England than they are in Scotland \u201d .\nBut this figure does not account for the difference in population , or the number of A & E attendances , in the two nations .\nAs the Scottish government itself told FactCheck , per head of population , the number of these long waits is around five times higher in England than Scotland .\nThat \u2019 s substantially less than \u201c 50 times more \u201d , as the First Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raw figure and per capita comparisons are \u201c all accurate representations of the published information .\n\u201d", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url":

currencies in the days since chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng \u2019 s first \u201c mini \u201d budget .\nNow some economists warn UK interest rates could reach 6 per cent next year , which would be the highest level since 1999 .\nThis would have huge ramifications for those with mortgages , or who are trying to buy their first home .\nAt least six mortgage lenders have already said they temporarily can \u2019 t offer loans to new customers because they don \u2019 t know whether potential borrowers can afford them .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as landlords face higher costs to pay off their own mortgages .\nSo what \u2019 s behind the currency crash ?\nWhy could it lead to higher interest rates ?\nAnd what might it mean for the cost of living ?\nWelcome to the FactCheck beginner \u2019 s guide .\nDid the \u2018 mini \u2019 budget cause the currency crash ?\nBoth the pound and the euro have been declining against the dollar since Russia began its full invasion of Ukraine in February this year , which the new chancellor \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his defence .\nThere are various reasons for this .\nThe international markets feared that European nations would be more vulnerable to energy price crises ( which so far , Europe has been ) , compared to the US , which is generally less reliant on buying energy from abroad .\nAdd to that the fact that the US Federal Reserve \u2013 the stateside equivalent of the Bank of England \u2013 has recently increased interest rates .\nThat has made the dollar more attractive , for reasons we \u2019 ll get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound that we \u2019 ve seen in recent days was not matched by an equivalent fall in the euro .\nAnd the steepest decline began in the minutes after Kwasi Kwarteng made his speech .\nSo while there may have been ongoing issues with sterling , it looks like the new chancellor \u2019 s announcements exacerbated them .\nWhy did the government \u2019 s announcements worry the markets ?\nIt appears that the markets lost confidence in the UK economy because Mr Kwarteng announced an almost unprecedented \u2013 and unexpected \u2013 increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra borrowing was coming , just not quite this much . )\nThough the UK \u2019 s debt is lower than some major economies \u2019 , investors are often wary of putting money into countries that are increasing their own debt \u2013 especially by an amount that wasn \u2019 t previously predicted .\nAnd while on paper the new chancellor \u2019 s massive tax cuts might increase UK GDP , there are fears that this will exacerbate the cost of living by driving up inflation .\nAll of this seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK less inviting than it was before Mr Kwarteng stood up in Parliament on Friday .\nWhy are people talking about interest rates ?\nInterest is the reward you get for putting your money in a bank account and , conversely , the price you pay for borrowing money .\nThe \u201c base rate \u201d is the minimum interest rate that individual banks in the country offer savers or charge borrowers \u2013 though they can set their interest rates higher if they want .\nThe base rate is set by the central bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s the Bank of England .\nIf the Bank of England raises the base rate , investors get more return on their money if they put them in UK banks , which encourages international traders to buy sterling , and pushes up its price .\nThat \u2019 s partly why all eyes are on the central bank in the midst of this currency crash .\nIn theory , the Bank of England could help reverse the pound \u2019 s downward trend by raising the base rate .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does it mean for inflation ?\nRaising the base rate would also have another benefit : helping to keep inflation under control .\nMaking borrowing more expensive means fewer people take out loans , and people who already have mortgages have to spend more on interest payments \u2013 and therefore have less to spend in the wider economy .\nThis dampens down consumer demand for goods and services , which in turn reduces so-called \u201c demand pull \u201d inflation .\nSo if the crashing pound prompts the Bank of England to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lower inflation and help solve the cost of living crisis ?\nThe UK relies heavily on importing goods from abroad .\nA weaker pound means UK companies have to spend more to buy those foreign products \u2013 and these extra costs are often passed on to the customer in the form of higher prices .\nSo unless and until higher interest rates increase the value of the pound , UK consumers may still find the price of everyday items is going up , not down .\nAnd if interest rates push up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living will also be higher for the 6.8 million households that face higher repayments .\n( Though , to be clear , those on fixed rate mortgages would only see their costs rise once they come to remortgage at the new higher rates . )\nThe government is under pressure from around the world to keep the economy on track .\nThe International Monetary Fund made a rare rebuke of the UK on Wednesday , saying : \u201c given elevated inflation pressures in many countries , including the UK , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this juncture \u201d .\nIn other words , cutting taxes as Mr Kwarteng has done might make the cost of living crisis worse .", "author": "Georgina

.\nWhat did the Bank do ?\nGilts ( also known as government bonds ) are basically an \u201c IOU \u201d issued by the government , promising to pay the owner a sum of money in the future .\nIf the government wants to borrow money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days after Kwasi Kwarteng announced a load of tax cuts \u2013 some expected , some not \u2013 on 23 September , the price of UK gilts plummeted .\nThe markets were apparently worried about how much extra borrowing the new chancellor was committing to .\nMore borrowing means the government has to issue more gilts .\nWith an increased supply , the value of each individual gilt would go down .\nTraders didn \u2019 t want to hold on to their gilts if they expected them to fall in value in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That meant the supply rose anyway , and the value of each one dropped .\nThis was a big problem for pension funds , which rely on gilt prices remaining stable .\nWhen gilt prices decline as they did last week , pension funds risk falling into a \u201c doom loop \u201d \u2013 a vicious cycle of price drops , fire sales and financial instability which could ultimately lead to their collapse .\nThe Bank of England was so worried about this that it stepped in and said it would buy back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTo be fair to Mr Kwarteng , the UK gilt market , along with other countries \u2019 bond markets , has been on rocky ground for several months due to factors largely beyond the government \u2019 s control .\nBut the chancellor seemed unable to accept this morning that his mini budget even played a part in the latest crisis .\n\u201c What happened in the gilt market has got nothing to do with that , \u201d he told LBC \u2019 s Nick Ferrari , adding later that \u201c that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tax measures that we announced in the mini budget \u201d .\nYet the Bank of England disagrees .\nChief monetary economist Huw Pill said last week that the recent round of \u201c fiscal announcements \u201d \u2013 i.e .\nthe mini budget \u2013 was one of the reasons the gilt price had dropped so low .\nIn other words , the government \u2019 s mini budget did contribute to the problem that the Bank of England had to step in and fix .\nA Treasury spokesperson told FactCheck : \u201c There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen significant volatility in recent weeks , with all major currencies wrestling an incredibly strong US dollar .\nLike many other countries , the UK is not immune from that disruption.\n\u201d Kwasi Kwarteng said his mini budget had \u201c nothing to do \u201d with the collapse in gilt prices last week

against the Bournemouth West MP in 2017 and alleged incidents said to have taken place in 2013 .\nMr Burns vigorously denies the allegations saying that they are \u201c without merit \u201d and were withdrawn \u201c almost immediately \u201d before an investigation even took place .\nHe told us the complaint was never put to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad faith actor motivated by malice \u201d .\nThe complaint is unrelated to the alleged incident at a bar in Birmingham \u2019 s Hyatt Hotel at the conference earlier this month , that led to him being sacked as Minister for Trade Policy by Prime Minister Liz Truss .\nDowning Street insisted the Prime Minister was not made aware of the 2017 sexual harassment claim when she appointed Mr Burns as a Minister for Trade on 7 September .\nPrior to his appointment Mr Burns was vetted by the Cabinet Office \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office told Channel 4 News it also had not known about the previous 2017 complaint .\nThe complaint against Mr Burns in 2017 concerned allegations of inappropriate conduct against one individual in 2013 .\nThe complaint was referred to the Conservative Party from the Chief Whip \u2019 s Office .\nChannel 4 News understands the 2017 complaint resulted in the commencement of a process under the rules of the Conservative Party Code of Conduct .\nThe Conservative Party said the complaint was withdrawn shortly after it was made .\nThey declined to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel 4 News understands the allegations were withdrawn due to a lack of confidence in the complaints process .\nThe party insisted it had \u201c due regard for due process \u201d .\nWhen Channel 4 News asked the party if they had received a complaint about Mr Burns in 2017 it initially responded saying it had not received one .\nBut after Channel 4 News produced further evidence the party said , while an initial check did not indicate a complaint had been made , they wished to clarify and confirm a complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Conservative Party spokesperson told Channel 4 News : \u201c As there is currently an active investigation involving Mr. Burns , we are unable to comment further.\n\u201d Conor Burns was fired last Friday , after an allegation of \u201c serious misconduct \u201d at the bar at the Hyatt Regency Hotel during the Conservative Party Conference .\nHe denies the claim .\nMr Burns lost his job as Trade Policy Minister and has had the whip withdrawn while a formal investigation takes place .\nHe has protested his innocence in a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 News earlier this week .\nHe said previously : \u201c I \u2019 ve been overwhelmed by the support from my colleagues , who have found it beyond strange that the whip was withdrawn , and I was sacked from ministerial office , without being given the opportunity to be told what the allegation was , or how I could engage in the process to respond to it .\n\u201c I used to live in a country where the rule of law , natural justice and a process took place , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d In a letter to Channel 4 News , he said the allegations were never put to him and there was never an investigation .\nBoth of the claims , which are unrelated , have not been proven .", "author": "Serena Barker-Singh", "url": "https://www.channel4.com/news/cchq-confirms-conor-burns-mp-was-subject-of-sexual-harassment-complaint-in-2017-2",

claims corporation tax cut would raise money", "content": "That \u2019 s what Jeremy Hunt told the House of Commons yesterday .\nThe new chancellor was defending his decision to raise corporation tax \u2013 which companies pay on their profits \u2013 in direct contradiction to prime minister Liz Truss \u2019 previous plan to keep it at current levels .\nThe u-turn was an attempt to calm the financial markets by showing \u201c fiscal discipline \u201d \u2013 effectively , that the government is capable of balancing the books .\nBut it will have been painful for Mr Hunt , who pledged to cut corporation tax in both of his ill-fated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , judging by his comments in Parliament yesterday , it seems the chancellor still believes that lowering corporation tax would raise more money for the exchequer in the long term .\nSo , is he right ?\nLaffer-ing all the way to the bank ?\nThe idea that cutting taxes brings in more money for the government might sound strange , but it \u2019 s not without its supporters .\nThe best known is Arthur Laffer , an American economist who advised President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s .\nHis eponymous \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that raising the rate of tax increases revenues \u2013 until it doesn \u2019 t .\nThe theory goes that at a certain point , if the government puts up tax rates on businesses or on individuals any further , it \u2019 ll encourage firms to leave the country , or to move their taxable assets overseas .\nIn other words , raising the tax rate after this point will reduce the total amount of money the government takes in .\nConversely , reducing business taxes makes the country more attractive for international companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exchequer gets tax income that would otherwise have gone to foreign governments .\nTaxes cut , yet more money in the public coffers .\nA political win-win .\nThat \u2019 s the idea , at least .\nBut does it work in the UK ?\nAndy King , chief of staff at the Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR ) spending watchdog , says not .\n\u201c Tax cuts don \u2019 t pay for themselves and would not improve the long-term financial position , \u201d he said in July .\n\u201c In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we look at tax cuts , the direct fiscal cost of cutting that tax outweighs the indirect fiscal benefit of improved economic activity.\n\u201d The Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) think tank was similarly confident in 2019 , responding to then-leadership hopeful Mr Hunt \u2019 s proposal to slash the main corporation tax rate from 19 per cent to 12.5 per cent .\n\u201c This is not a tax cut that would pay for itself as some have claimed , \u201d the experts wrote .\n\u201c Our existing tax base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible that this loss of revenue could be made up a result of higher profits being reported in the UK.\n\u201d And as FactCheck reported last month , while total corporation tax revenue rose the last time the headline rate was cut , the IFS is clear : this was not because of the cut .\nJeremy Hunt said that reducing corporation tax would raise more money for the government in the long run .\nSome economists subscribe to a theory that would support this claim .\nBut in practice , independent experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Institute for Fiscal Studies are clear : this is not true in the UK .\nUpdate , 6pm : After we published this article , the Treasury contacted us to say : \u201c There is a range of academic evidence which suggests that low Corporation Tax can boost investment and growth , and therefore lead to higher tax revenue .\n\u201d", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url": "https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-hunt-claims-corporation-tax-cut-would-raise-money", "published": "Tue, 18 Oct 2022 16:13:08

Dependencies ( Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man ) .\nIt allows British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two countries .\nIt \u2019 s not set out in a single treaty , but evolved after Ireland gained independence from the UK in 1922 .\nWould an independent Scotland be in the Common Travel Area ?\nThe CTA covers the territory and people of Scotland , but does not treat Scotland as a separate entity because it \u2019 s currently part of the UK .\nIf Scotland became independent , the arrangements for crossing into what remained of the UK would have to be negotiated as part of an exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published this week setting out the case for independence , the Scottish government acknowledges this .\nIt says : \u201c As an independent country , and a member of the EU , Scotland would make arrangements for its border with the UK on the basis of EU law and a negotiated agreement with the UK.\n\u201d Later , the paper says \u201c it would make sense for all parties \u201d if the CTA arrangements covering Ireland were \u201c to apply to Scotland in the event of independence \u201d .\nIn other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CTA \u2013 or some other \u201c arrangements \u201d that replicate the CTA \u2013 is still up for discussion , despite the First Minister \u2019 s comments this week .\nNow , it \u2019 s very likely that the UK would want to keep travel across the Anglo-Scottish border as easy as possible .\nFactCheck spoke to Professors Nicola McEwan and Katy Hayward of the UK in a Changing Europe network at King \u2019 s College , London .\n\u201c There is no indication that Scotland would be prevented from staying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they told us in a joint statement .\n\u201c Scotland staying in [ the CTA ] would be in the interests of both sides.\n\u201d But they also noted that , \u201c as with all border-related matters , it takes two sides to keep a border open or soft and only one side to harden it.\n\u201d \u201c So [ \u2026 ] the Scottish government could not unilaterally decide to stay inside the CTA , but another government could unilaterally decide to effectively exclude Scotland from it.\n\u201d Though they stressed \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parties.\n\u201d Would passports be needed at the border between Scotland and England ?\nThe Scottish government says an independent Scotland would want to join the EU .\nNew EU member states are required to sign up to the Schengen Agreement .\nOn paper , this means removing border controls between Scotland and the other 26 members of the EU \u2013 as well as obliging Scotland to control the flow of people across the border with the UK because the latter is no longer in the trade bloc .\nA recent UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Thus , if Scotland joined the Schengen area , it would imply the need for passport controls between Scotland and its nearest neighbour.\n\u201d \u201c However , \u201d the authors continue , \u201c given its unique geographic and historic circumstances , most specifically the existence of the Common Travel Area ( CTA ) , most experts assume that Scotland would most likely seek and be granted an opt-out from the border control elements of the Schengen Agreement during membership negotiations with the European Union.\n\u201d Though , as Professor Imelda Maher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still be \u201c a bit of negotiating required if Scotland wanted to opt out of Schengen and have something like the CTA \u201d .\nProfessors McEwan and Hayward told FactCheck : \u201c we are as confident as it is possible to be that , in the event of independence , there would [ be ] no requirement for passport checks at the Anglo-Scottish border.\n\u201d So again , it \u2019 s likely that Scotland would be able to secure passport-free movement with England \u2013 but not guaranteed until deals are struck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent Scotland also managed to join the EU , it would create a new external border for the trade bloc in the middle of the British Isles .\nAnd it \u2019 s worth pointing out that the CTA only applies to citizens of the countries that are part of it .\nSo , even if Scotland joins the CTA , the arrangement would only cover British , Irish and Scottish nationals .\nUnless Scotland manages to negotiate some additional terms , that would mean people from other EU countries , and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the Anglo-Scottish border may face new constraints or paperwork .\nProfessor Colin Murray of the University of Newcastle told FactCheck : \u201c Just as with the NI/Ireland land border post Brexit , [ \u2026 ] there will need to be travel authorisations or visas for non-CTA member citizens.\n\u201d He notes that \u201c the UK Government has already legislated to introduce [ Electronic Travel Authorisations ] which look set to apply to border crossings in Ireland for non-CTA member citizens from next year.\n\u201d So , while the Scottish government would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens from beyond the CTA area crossing the border , it can \u2019 t control what the UK government might do .\nScotland \u2019 s Europe minister Neil Gray issued this statement to FactCheck via a spokesperson : \u201c The economy paper clearly sets out proposals for Scotland to re-join the EU whilst remaining part of the Common Travel Area ( CTA ) .\nIreland is both an EU member state and is in the CTA \u2013 this is a longstanding arrangement that is recognised in EU treaties .\n\u201c Scotland will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all parties .\nRights to travel , live , work and access services would be protected and would continue for British and Irish citizens in Scotland , and for the citizens of an independent Scotland in the UK and Ireland .\n\u201c Becoming an independent country and re-joining the EU would ensure the free movement of people and goods to the 27 EU member states.\n\u201d Nicola Sturgeon said this week that an independent Scotland \u201c will remain in the Common Travel Area \u201d , that there will be no passport checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free movement of people \u201c will continue as before \u201d .\nGiven the political , economic and practical implications , it \u2019 s likely that the UK , Ireland and Scotland would agree to Scotland participating in the Common Travel Area after independence , which should facilitate travel across the Anglo-Scottish border .\nBut , despite the First Minister \u2019 s comments , this is not guaranteed and would require negotiation with all the parties .\nScotland can not decide this unilaterally .\nSimilarly , it \u2019 s very likely that Scots would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England \u2013 but again , this would need to be agreed as part of an exit deal and is therefore not something the First Minister can yet guarantee .\nWhether free movement of people would continue as before is complicated by the Scottish government \u2019 s ambition for Scotland to join the EU .\nIt is possible that people crossing between the Anglo-Scottish border who are not citizens of either country would need to complete travel documents , just as the UK government is set to require of non-British-or-Irish citizens crossing the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate all of these issues if it secures independence from the UK .\nAs with Brexit negotiations , all parties will have to make compromises .\nScotland \u2019 s Europe minister told FactCheck : \u201c Scotland will remain in the CTA because it makes sense for all parties .\n\u201d", "author": "Georgina Lee", "url":

"source": "channel4uk", "title": "FactCheck: Sunak claims violent crime rising in Scotland", "content": "That was the claim from Rishi Sunak as he faced MPs in the House of Commons for the first time as prime minister .\nHe was responding to a question from the SNP \u2019 s Ian Blackford , and seemed to use the claim as a criticism of the SNP-led Scottish government , which has responsibility for policing .\nBut the evidence we have is far from conclusive .\nIt looks like the new prime minister is referring to the fact that Scottish police recorded 12 per cent more non-sexual violent crimes in 2021-22 than in the previous year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPolice recorded sexual crimes are now at a 51-year high .\nHowever , the same dataset also shows a 23 per cent fall in police recorded non-sexual crimes of violence since 2008-09 .\nAnd , as regular FactCheck readers will know , police records are not a comprehensive picture of crime for two reasons .\nThe first is that , as official Scottish government figures show , about half of crimes are never reported to the police ( we know this thanks to the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , it \u2019 s difficult to use police records to track changes over time because the police often change how they record crimes .\nSo a rise in police recorded crime may reflect administrative changes , rather than a change in the real-world crime rate .\nOne way to get round these issues is to look at the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey ( SCJS ) , which is run by official statisticians .\nThey interview a representative sample of the Scottish public to ask about their experiences of crime in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest SCJS , which covers 2019-20 , non-sexual violent crime has fallen 39 per cent since 2008-09 , when comparable data began .\nAnd the statisticians say there was no statistically significant change compared to the previous year .\n( That means that they estimated a possible increase in crime , but that they couldn \u2019 t be more than 95 per cent confident that it was genuine , and not a quirk in the data caused by chance . )\nRegarding sexual crimes , the SCJS estimates \u201c no change \u201d since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the proportion of people who experienced serious sexual assault in the previous 12 months .\n( That analysis covers Surveys conducted in 2018-19 and 2019-20 so the sample is big enough to make meaningful estimates . )\nThe SCJS is not perfect : it can \u2019 t tell us about crimes against businesses and it can only ever produce estimates of the number of crimes taking place , or the proportion of people who are victims of sexual crimes .\nBut it does give important insights into the crimes that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunak said that violent crime is rising in Scotland .\nBut the evidence we have shows a mixed picture .\nPolice in Scotland recorded more sexual and non-sexual violent crimes in the last year than in the previous 12 months .\nBut compared to 2008-09 , police recorded non-sexual violent crime has fallen by nearly a quarter .\nAnd by another major measure \u2013 the annual Scottish Crime and Justice Survey \u2013 the number of non-sexual violent crimes is the same as it was in the previous year , and is much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this measure , the proportion of people victimised by sexual crimes has stayed at the same level

cases involved pregnancy or miscarriage in the victim .\nSo , our figure may include cases where the victim was not pregnant at the time of the incident , nor miscarried as a result \u2013 but that pregnancy or miscarriage was relevant to the case in some other way and was therefore included in the police record of the incident .\nHowever , Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of women experiencing domestic abuse have reported it to the police .\nSo , it \u2019 s likely that our figures underestimate the true extent of violence against pregnant women and girls .\nFor a fuller picture , we would normally look to the Crime Survey of England and Wales , which is carried out by the ONS .\nThese figures can tell us about domestic abuse incidents that are never reported to the police .\nThe latest Crime Survey found that an estimated 2.3 million adults in England and Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to March 2020 .\nOf those , 1.6 million were women .\nHowever , these figures can \u2019 t tell us specifically about women and girls who have been abused while pregnant , or who have suffered a miscarriage as a result .\nSo , for now , police records \u2013 although imperfect \u2013 are one of the few ways to measure this type of violence .\nThe 2019 Conservative manifesto promised to \u201c support all victims of domestic abuse \u201d and to pass new legislation .\nThe Domestic Abuse Act became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its provisions \u2013 which include preventing abusers from cross-examining their victims in court , and a ban on the so-called \u201c rough sex gone wrong \u201d defence for those who seriously injure or kill a partner .\nHowever some campaigners , including Women \u2019 s Aid , say that the Act should have gone further to deliver \u201c equal

the secretary general of NATO , said on Wednesday that the alliance \u2019 s \u201c preliminary analysis \u201d is that it was more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Russia \u2019 s many cruise missiles and that it strayed into Polish territory accidentally .\nThough he added , \u201c this is not Ukraine \u2019 s fault \u201d and that \u201c Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine \u201d .\nWhat does this mean for NATO ?\nPoland is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , a defence pact between 30 member countries , including nuclear powers , the UK , France and the US .\nA strike on Polish soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the West .\nThe rules of NATO say that an attack on one member country is an attack on all .\nIf Tuesday \u2019

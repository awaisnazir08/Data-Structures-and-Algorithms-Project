stain of an American insurrection", "content": "January 6 is the day Christians mark the Epiphany , the revelation of Jesus Christ as the son of God .\nAs told in the Bible , three kings brought gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh that day to the infant Jesus in a Bethlehem stable .\nAccording to scripture , God made himself known so that people might know him .\nOne year ago today , thousands of self-proclaimed Christians descended upon the United States Capitol .\nThey were not there to honour the revelation of their heavenly God .\nInstead they were marching to the drum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , January 6 is also the day that American presidents are elected .\nCustom would have us believe this occurs on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November each leap year .\nThat is imprecise .\nOn the November Tuesday that Americans vote for their preferred candidate , they are actually choosing electors pledged to support a nominee for president .\nThese electors , who together comprise the Electoral College , are the middlemen in the process .\nWhile their role is typically ceremonial , their votes are anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Wednesday in December , the electors assemble in their respective states to formalise the voters \u2019 intent .\nTheir choices for president and vice-president are recorded on certificates of vote .\nEach state then sends these certificates to Congress , where they are counted in a joint session of both chambers .\nThe count happens on January 6 .\nThis timeline is essential to understanding the attack on the Capitol by Donald Trump \u2019 s foot soldiers .\nMany may not have understood why the timeline mattered .\nHowever , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who led them into battle , most definitely did .\nTheir objective that day was simple : stop the count by any means necessary .\nElection of a president requires at least 270 Electoral College votes .\nThis represents a majority of the 538 votes available .\nIf no candidate reaches this threshold , the House of Representatives chooses the next president from the three leading candidates .\nEach state delegation votes as a bloc , with one vote each state .\nHad this happened last January , Republicans would have controlled 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in the minority overall , and would have returned Trump to the Oval Office .\nThey would have overridden the will of American voters to do so .\nThis was the plan .\nDemocracy be damned .\nTrump and his allies had several contingencies to accomplish their coup .\nThen-vice-president Mike Pence was to preside over the joint session and supervise the count .\nThe first option relied on Pence to reject electoral votes from several states , leaving Trump ahead albeit short of 270 votes .\nThen Pence would either declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purported lead from accepted votes , or force the House of Representatives to decide .\nHowever , Pence had no authority to ignore valid , certified votes .\nTrump , a man who never met a rule he wouldn \u2019 t break , wanted him to do so anyway .\nHaving explored all avenues in advance to appease Trump , Pence ultimately refused .\nAfter four years of unwavering loyalty to his boss , he drew the line at treason .\nTrump was outraged .\nHe screamed : \u201c No , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mike .\nYou can do this .\nI don \u2019 t want to be your friend any more if you don \u2019 t do this.\n\u201d The following day , January 6 , Trump dispatched the mob assembled at his rally outside the White House to march on the Capitol .\nThey arrived with a gallows chanting \u201c Hang Mike Pence !\n\u201d The so-called protest quickly morphed into insurrection as the rioters overwhelmed police and stormed the building .\nThis was no accident .\nRingleaders within the crowd knew exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Pence wouldn \u2019 t do Trump \u2019 s bidding , they would foil the count themselves .\nThe rioters overran the Capitol and occupied the Senate floor .\nThey hoped to steal the boxes containing the official votes .\nThat would have thrown the count into chaos , as Trump intended .\nSome went prepared to take hostages , and potentially execute members of Congress .\nIn addition to Pence , Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were their prime targets .\nHad any of them or their colleagues been assassinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders by declaring a national emergency and sending in the military .\nEither stolen votes or an emergency declaration would have given cover for Republicans in the House of Representatives to intervene and retain Trump as president .\nThis was the plan .\nThanks to quick thinking , fast action , and selfless bravery by congressional members and personnel , the plan failed .\nPolice fought hard against the invaders , delaying their breach and buying time for members and staff to evacuate .\nCrucially aides carried the mahogany boxes containing the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunkered down in the bowels of the Capitol , rebuffed Secret Service demands that he be driven to a secure location .\nHad he left , he might not have been able to return .\nThat could have been used as another pretext to prevent the count .\nWith no votes to steal , and no officials to take hostage or kill , the insurrection collapsed .\nTrump was forced to release a mealy-mouthed video urging the rioters to go home .\nSo they did .\nLate that night the joint session reconvened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kamala Harris .\nDespite all the turmoil and terror of the day , 147 Republicans still played their part with spurious objections to the results .\nThey were all committed to the plan to the bitter end .\nBut the jig was up .\nHow do we know all this ?\nBecause they wrote it down .\nThere was a PowerPoint blueprint mapping out the entire strategy .\nTrump \u2019 s final White House chief of staff , Mark Meadows , handed the blueprint to the bipartisan January 6 Committee investigating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , texts , telephone logs and other data .\nThe committee has made substantial headway towards unravelling the attempted coup .\nCommittee investigators have interviewed more than 300 witnesses , including several implicated in the plot , and have gathered reams of evidence as further proof .\nPublic hearings will be televised in the coming months to reveal the facts to the American public .\nIt is beyond doubt there was a conspiracy coordinated from the White House to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 election .\nThis treason makes Watergate look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed federal and state crimes .\nMany of them will go to prison .\nDespite this ocean of treachery , Republicans remain favourites to regain control of the House of Representatives in next November \u2019 s midterm elections .\nThey have made plain that they will end all inquiries by the January 6 Committee .\nThis has raised fears that the coup plotters will escape accountability for their crimes .\nThese concerns are unnecessary .\nCommittee members are well aware of the ticking political clock .\nWe can expect they will conclude their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s end .\nIn any case , the committee has no power to lay criminal charges .\nHowever , it can refer findings to the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) with recommendations for prosecution .\nThis it will certainly do .\nIf Republicans shut down the committee , DOJ will still have at least two years to prosecute the offenders .\nAfter the November 2020 election , Trump blocked the normal transition process from one administration to the next , even though the law required it .\nDeploying his usual modus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to dare anyone to do anything about it .\nAt the time most people chalked it up to petulance .\nEveryone knew Trump was a sore loser .\nThe reality was far worse .\nHe obstructed the transition because he wasn \u2019 t going anywhere .\nTrump committed a monstrous crime .\nFor that he needed a monstrous justification to incite his supporters .\nThus was born his Big Lie that the election had been stolen .\nWhen the whole truth is laid bare , let \u2019 s hope some of Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own .", "author": "Keir

Novak Djokovic saga ended in deep embarrassment for the federal government , immigration bureaucrats and the lonely remnants of Fortress Australia .\nIn the end , the backdown was swift .\nAfter

Minister Scott Morrison , is considering whether to cancel Djokovic \u2019 s visa .\nPolitically this would be a major doubling down from the government on maintaining tough , pandemic-driven border

likely to have lawyers back in front of Kelly , this time to argue the substantive issues around the visa cancellation .\nOn yesterday \u2019 s evidence , his honour wasn \u2019 t all too pleased

and ( least importantly ) Australia \u2019 s gothic horror migration system \u2014 have already collided in the fulcrum of the most profound question we could ever ask ourselves : how badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to kill the Australian Open ?\nThat \u2019 s pretty much it , so far as history will record .\nThat time when the world \u2019 s No .\n1 tennis player fought the system and won , bringing down a country in the process .\nThe legal arguments are intensely technical , and as I expressed on Twitter yesterday , Djokovic had a pretty good case and was likely to win on the basis that the Australian Border Force fucked up its own decision-making process by giving him a notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was so badly flawed that it was rendered invalid .\nNo valid notice , no valid cancellation .\nTurns out I was right , and the judge has now sent the problem back to the immigration minister to do his job properly .\nThe government can then , validly , cancel Djokovic \u2019 s visa again , either on the same grounds ( him not being vaccinated ) or wielding its almost unlimited power to decide who gets to enter the country .\nIt could \u2014 and I absolutely dare it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he \u2019 d have no grounds for appeal whatsoever .\nThe only relevance of the law here is that this case points up that our Migration Act is \u2014 following decades of tinkering with

guarantee a circus .\nAll they needed to do was get on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut no .\nInstead , each authority issued contradictory messages to each other and Djokovic , guaranteeing the debacle that has ensued .\nNone of that matters for the law ; the Migration Act says you can \u2019 t enter Australia without a valid visa and it gives the power to issue , refuse and cancel visas to the federal

investing in their future with confidence \u201d .\nBut this blind optimism hides the facts .\nOmicron has choked Australia \u2019 s supply chains .\nWe have more staff shortages now than during the peak of the Delta outbreak .\nEven before Omicron hit , employers were short 400,000 workers .\nSince the pandemic , the labour force has barely grown .\nThere are warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy to address inflation faster than it is .\nThe economic catastrophe was totally predictable and avoidable \u2014 but the government was focused on protecting the economy in the short term rather than planning for the long term .\nOn November 10 Morrison told students to \u201c get excited , be positive , be optimistic \u201d .\nSpeaking to Year 11 and 12 students , he said that although the pandemic had robbed them of much of their high school experience , they \u2019 ll be \u201c a resilient generation \u2026 unlike others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to get through \u201d .\nBut once again , optimism was short-lived .\nQueensland pushed back school starting dates by two weeksand very public spats have emerged between COVID-19 experts calling for unvaccinated kids to be kept safe in

was explicit : \u201c While the order does not apply to religious services , it does apply to major recreation facilities and this event is clearly in breach of the spirit and intent of the order.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit and intent of the law .\nNot its letter .\nSo what \u2019 s the truth here ?\nDid Hillsong break the law or not ?\nThe answer is , unequivocally , no .\nLet \u2019 s go to the law .\nThe public health order , in its latest form , makes two specific provisions for \u201c singing and dancing \u201d .\nIn combination , they require occupiers of premises of these types to ensure that nobody ( apart from performers ) sings or dances there : The last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major recreation facility \u201d is defined in the order as \u201c a building or place used for large-scale sporting or recreation activities that are attended by large numbers of people whether regularly or periodically , and includes theme parks , sports stadiums , racecourses and motor racing tracks \u201d .\nThe Hillsong Wildlife Summercamp was held at the Glenrock Scout Camp in Newcastle .\nMuch as NSW Health would like to insist that it validly \u201c deemed the location to be a major recreation facility \u201d , it has no such deeming power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well outside the definition .\nBut was the Hillsong jamboree a \u201c music festival \u201d ?\nWell , that is defined as an event that is \u201c music-focused or dance-focused \u201d , which Hillsong would justifiably assert its Summercamp was not .\nWhile it may be that the kids spent all three days and nights singing and dancing their faith away , Hillsong would say that that wasn \u2019 t the \u201c focus \u201d , and who \u2019 s to second-guess it ?\nAn attempted prosecution would have failed , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying .\nAs to whether any of this makes logical or moral sense , that \u2019 s another question .\nThe prohibition on singing and dancing at music festivals was added to the public health order two days before the Hillsong festival kicked off .\nThe entertainment industry is deeply wounded , financially and spiritually , by what it perceives as constant unfair targeting of its business by the NSW government throughout the pandemic .\nAll COVID-related restrictions can only be justified on the basis of protecting public health .\nIt is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event and a music festival as defined which would support a conclusion that the latter is more dangerous than the former .\nThat \u2019 s because it \u2019 s impossible to distinguish between Hillsong \u2019 s party and a music festival in ordinary terms ; however , in the language of the public health order , the difference exists .\nThe real difference is a direct reflection of the priorities of the NSW government , which have been plainly on show throughout the pandemic .\nIt considers the freedom of activity for religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be preserved or restored as early as possible whenever public health has required its temporary impingement .\nIt has no regard for the entertainment industry whatsoever , nor for the public health benefits of allowing young people to do as they \u2019 re naturally inclined .\nThe government isn \u2019 t necessarily wrong about this , but it should be transparently prepared to argue its case .\nThe fact is that Hillsong did what the law allows it to do , and the government should not be pretending otherwise .\nIf it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then own up and change the law .\nWe \u2019 re all sick to death of being lied to .\nDoes this infuriate you ?\nShould

Morrison government lurching from one bungle to another , not merely stuffing up the simple deportation of an unvaccinated tennis player who should never have been let in the country , but the altogether more serious challenges of ensuring sufficient COVID testing capacity and preventing the inevitable consequences of its own national reopening plan from wrecking supply chains and service industries .\nThe result is a national shortage of rapid antigen tests ( RATs ) in a world awash with the things , kilometres of empty supermarket shelves around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged care due to lack of staff , with a permanent state of lockdown for tens of thousands of seniors across the country for the foreseeable future .\nIf the vaccination rollout debacle was , in the words of Malcolm Turnbull , \u201c the biggest failure of public administration I can recall \u201d , then the RAT and supply chain debacles have to be in consideration for that title as well .\nThe failures are breathtaking for the simple fact that they reflect a failure to think through the obvious consequences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , in mid-2021 : a surge in infection numbers , but with a dramatic lowering of intensity of symptoms and rates of hospitalisation and death due to vaccination .\nWhile the Omicron variant may have changed the numbers at the margin , Australia \u2019 s plan was always to accept a massive increase in infections , while serious cases remained low and primarily confined to the unvaccinated .\nYet no one within the Morrison government undertook any planning for exactly the scenario we were relying on to transition back to something vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with large numbers of infected workers , how long do they isolate , if at all , how do they get tested , how long are they required to be absent from the workplace , how long might they be absent because they \u2019 re ill , and how will industries with already significant workforce issues , or serving vulnerable communities , or both , cope with a large number of infections ?\nThat failure of planning echoes the failure to avoid overreliance on one source of vaccines and the failure to properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aged care and disability residential facilities in 2020-21 , with the difference that the government has had an extra year to get planning right .\nWe \u2019 ve previously connected the routine incompetence of the Morrison government to Scott Morrison \u2019 s obsessive lying , and to the fact that Morrison by his own admission runs government for his mates i.e .\nas a protection racket , in which corporations purchase policy outcomes in exchange for donations and post-political jobs .\nMorrison \u2019 s preference for media conferences and press releases over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it \u2019 s time to look beyond just the personal characteristics of Morrison \u2019 s government to see if this repeated failure is becoming systemic in Canberra .\nWill better government be delivered by a different prime minister or a different party ?\nOr has something structural happened to the federal government \u2019 s capacity to function effectively ?\nThis is a much more complex issue than simply criticising Morrison as incompetent , as even some of the most banal , centrist press gallery types have finally begun doing .\nVirtually no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a public policy problem , rather than a political one : only Michael Pascoe and , today , Alan Kohler , both at The New Daily , have tried to fathom exactly what is going wrong within the people charged with running the country .\nKohler argues that the failures represent the consequences of neoliberalism and its prevailing ethic of government withdrawal in favour of markets .\nThere \u2019 s much that is true in that analysis .\nIf you believe governments shouldn \u2019 t do things , the muscle memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanishes , and when time comes for government intervention , particularly of any complexity , it involves relearning some very basic skills all over again .\nRemember , this is a government that , as the car park rorts scandal shows , can \u2019 t even pork-barrel effectively , so it \u2019 s unsurprising that it struggles with more substantive policy challenges .\nWhat specifically has gone wrong within the government , and within the public service , that has seen a withering of capacity for effective intervention ?\nIs it readily remediable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences for some time to come ?\nTomorrow : the decline of functional government in the Commonwealth\u2026 Do you think Scott

unwilling to govern: the Morrison legacy may last many years", "content": "Under the traditional Canberra model of public policy , the issue of the impact of reopening the economy on the workforce and supply chains would have been dealt with something like this .\nOnce national cabinet had agreed on a reopening plan driven by vaccination rates , with modelling showing a big rise in infections but not of hospitalisations and deaths , Scott Morrison and the department of Prime Minister and Cabinet ( PM & C ) would have coordinated an existing , or new if necessary , inter-departmental committee to assess the likely impacts of a sharp rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on education , on health care and on supply chains .\nDepartments like Infrastructure , Health , Industry , Home Affairs and Workplace Relations would have been involved .\nIndustry and perhaps unions would have been consulted .\nThis would have led to a briefing on expected impacts and solutions .\nNational cabinet could then consider what planning needed to be done jointly , and it would become the basis for a submission to Scott Morrison \u2019 s own cabinet on what Commonwealth actions were required in those areas where it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged care , logistics , border control , industrial relations .\nMinisters could have had a clear basis on which to make decisions about , for example , what to do if large numbers of workers in key sectors called in sick in the context of a reopening economy .\nPretty simple stuff .\nBut it didn \u2019 t happen , or if it did , Morrison and his cabinet ignored it .\nIndustry and health providers were actually ahead of the government : the Australian Medical Association warned Health of the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid antigen tests in September , only to be rebuffed by bureaucrats who claimed the government didn \u2019 t want to intervene in the market .\nThe latter comment serves to confirm that Alan Kohler \u2019 s argument that neoliberalism has enfeebled government by crippling its capacity and willingness to intervene has much going for it .\nAt Crikey we \u2019 ve made similar arguments about the vaccine rollout and in other areas such as the NBN .\nBut it \u2019 s also the case that government no longer functions in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its motivations and its leadership have all changed , in ways that have undermined its capacity to act effectively , even in the event it wishes to do so .\nThe capacity of government has diminished .\nFederal MPs are now drawn from a less diverse range of backgrounds than 30 years ago .\nBetween 40 % and 50 % of MPs in the current federal Parliament , depending on the party , are former political staffers ; the remainder consist largely of lawyers and bankers .\nThe dominance of former staffers affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MPs ( and the ministers drawn from their ranks ) , and the role of political staff .\nThe job is no longer about providing high quality political advice to ministers \u2014 it \u2019 s simply a stepping stone into Parliament for junior party workers .\nThis has coincided , under the current government , with an unusually poor-quality ministry with virtually no strong performers other than Ken Wyatt , who is working in his area of professional expertise .\nThe capacity of the public service ( APS ) has been , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its function have been handed to political donors , either via outsourcing to large consulting firms , or through corporate executives directly writing government policy .\nAnd decision-making has been shifted increasingly to ministers \u2019 offices and their staff , who operate with virtually no public accountability and thus have less incentive to ensure good process and sound reasoning .\nAs a consequence , high-quality public servants have decamped or been sacked for being too independent .\nThe current generation of public service executives is the weakest in living memory , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced secretary \u2014 Home Affairs \u2019 Mike Pezzullo \u2014 presides over the most disastrously incompetent department of all .\nThe motivations of government are now quite different , and not merely because of Scott Morrison \u2019 s obsession with announcements over substance .\nAs John Daley argued in his outstanding final report for the Grattan Institute , the transition of political staffing roles to career ladder changes the motivations of staffers to minimising political damage , not producing good policy .\nAnd the motivations of senior public servants are no longer the much-vaunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increasingly , aiming only to minimise embarrassment for the government .\nPublic servants by now know that undertaking planning or policy work that may result in embarrassment for the government far outweighs any benefits that might flow from it , and act accordingly .\nThe leadership of both the public service and the government is also at a nadir .\nThe APS is led by a political apparatchik , Phil Gaetjens , who operates as Scott Morrison \u2019 s personal fixer rather than the leader of the Australia \u2019 s premier public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by widespread agreement , persistently acted to politicise the public service .\nThis could partly be offset if the Prime Minister \u2019 s Office was a strong policy unit , but it \u2019 s the poorest we \u2019 ve seen in decades \u2014 worse than Tony Abbott \u2019 s or that of the last years of Howard .\nAbove all , Scott Morrison himself has deliberately crippled the public service by explicitly ordering it to abandon any goal of providing policy advice \u2014 in the \u201c Morrison Doctrine \u201d of the APS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes of the government .\nIt is not the APS \u2019 role to undertake planning , unless the government explicitly asks for such .\nAll policy must be determined purely by politicians and their staffers .\nThe result is a government machine that \u2014 even before any ideological overlay of \u201c small government \u201d or \u201c let the market decide \u201d \u2014 lacks capacity to anticipate or think through even moderately complex policy challenges , has no motivation or incentive to do so , and is actively discouraged by its leadership from doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government .\nHow much of this would be remedied by a new PM or new government ?\nA change of PM can do much : Malcolm Turnbull was interested in building a better , more effective and more competent public service \u2014 a task simply abandoned by his successor \u2014 and in innovation , digital transformation and , generally , good ideas in the public sector .\nHe returned the sacked treasury secretary Martin Parkinson to head PM & C .\nAt the same time , outsourcing , driven by strong fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating away at the entrails of the APS .\nThat damage has accelerated under Morrison , and will take a decade to repair , if anyone is interested in the task .\nThe skewing of public policy by the growth of political staffers is also unlikely to change any time soon .\nThere \u2019 s an example of what all this could mean in the long term .\nWhen Labor returned to power in 2007 and decided to take an activist approach to broadband infrastructure , it had to rebuild the Commonwealth \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground up , because that capacity had been corporatised , then privatised , under previous governments of both sides .\nThe rebuilding delayed the NBN rollout and left it vulnerable to a change of government .\nThe result more than a decade later is an unsatisfactory , wildly over-budget compromise infrastructure .\nOnce capacity and competence is lost , it can be very hard to get back .", "author": "Bernard Keane", "url":

Christmas Eve .\nAn open letter addressed to Robert and Council CEO Sue Thomas , signed by 138 members of the ARC \u2019 s college of experts , senior researchers across a range of disciplines who play a key role in assessing prospective grants , slammed the minister \u2019 s decision to block the projects on \u201c national interest \u201d grounds .\n\u201c Such interventions compromise the integrity of the research funding system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threaten to damage Australia \u2019 s international reputation , \u201d they wrote .\n\u201c At least two members of the college have already resigned in protest , and the incident has already attracted international concern.\n\u201d It follows an additional letter signed by more than 60 professors sent to the minister last week , and outcry from Nobel laureates JM Coetzee and Australian National University Vice-Chancellor Brian Schmidt .\nRobert , who took on the education portfolio after Alan Tudge was stood down pending an investigation into allegations of an abusive relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has broad power to veto any research project on national interest grounds , without providing further reasons .\nBut before projects reach the minister \u2019 s desk , they are subject to thorough , multi-level scrutiny by appointed subject matter experts .\nThey \u2019 re then voted on by the college of experts , and assessed according to criteria including feasibility , innovation and value .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very thorough process of peer review-based on explicit criteria that the applicant knows , \u201d Deakin University \u2019 s associate dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the ARC \u2019 s college of experts , told Crikey .\nThe minister then assesses \u201c the extent to which the research contributes to Australia \u2019 s national interest through its potential to have economic , commercial , environmental , social or cultural benefits to the Australian community.\n\u201d Of the six grants Robert vetoed , two focused on study of modern China , two on early English literature , one on science-fiction novels , and a final grant on the motivations of school students involved in climate action .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you \u2019 d have to argue that understanding politics in modern China had absolutely no benefit to Australia , \u201d Witcomb said .\n\u201c I find that rather hard to believe

humanities , covering topics like \u201c post-Orientalist art in the strait of Gibraltar \u201d and changing Chinese gender norms .\nThat year , Birmingham \u2019 s successor , Dan Tehan , introduced the national interest test into the minister \u2019 s approval for ARC grants .\nFacing anger from Labor \u2019 s Kim Carr after Birmingham \u2019 s vetoes , the government also introduced a requirement that a minister must reveal when they blocked a grant .\nA further tightening to the ARC grants processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unveiled a plan to tie funding to the government \u2019 s research commercialisation agenda .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve not only got no accountability about what national interest might be , we \u2019 ve also got a narrowing of what that national interest might be in the future by making it more utilitarian , \u201d Witcomb said .\nThe ARC college of experts wants funding to abide by the Haldan Principles , where research decisions are made by independent peer

social media platform was taken over last year and quietly rebranded as \u201c Australian-Chinese New Life \u201d .\nEfforts by the government to reclaim it have failed .\nFor Liberal Senator James Paterson , chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security and a China hawk , the account takeover is a sign of foreign interference .\nGovernment MPs are pledging to boycott the platform ahead of the next election .\nFor Huang Aipeng , chief executive of Fuzhou 985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , the whole thing was a simple commercial transaction .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t even know who [ Scott ] Morrison is .\nI saw the account has a lot of followers , so we bought it , \u201d Huang told the ABC .\nThat the new owners \u2019 registered website is a Chinese underground sports betting company adds another layer of murk .\nBut whatever the reasons behind the takeover , the saga shows how Australian politicians \u2019 relationship with WeChat , and China in general have changed since 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly uneasy relationship with WeChat .\nThe platform has more than a billion users worldwide , and is popular among Australia \u2019 s large Chinese diaspora .\nIt made sense for politicians to get in on the WeChat action , and that \u2019 s exactly what happened before the 2019 election , when both Morrison and former opposition leader Bill Shorten joined .\nThe one catch is that WeChat , and its parent company Tencent , operates under Chinese law , and is therefore subject to censorship , surveillance and data sharing obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One main difference between WeChat and Western platforms like Facebook is it has to constantly strike a balance between its commercial interests and the CCP \u2019 s ideological interests , \u201d Deakin University researcher Fan Yang said .\nFor domestic politicians , that means complying with WeChat \u2019 s rules for official accounts .\nIt explains why when Morrison , Shorten and others set up their accounts in 2019 , they registered through a Chinese national .\nThis was in order to access the perks of an \u201c official \u201d WeChat account .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices outsourcing handling of the platform to marketing agencies with links to China , who then sought third parties to register their accounts under .\nMorrison \u2019 s account , for example , was originally registered by a person in Fuzhou , known as \u201c Mr Ji \u201d .\nAccording to Australian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst Fergus Ryan , this method was \u201c ill-advised \u201d because it meant politicians didn \u2019 t have ultimate control over their account .\nWe don \u2019 t know anything about \u201c Mr Ji \u201d or why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we do know that since 2020 , the accounts of Labor politicians like Dan Andrews and Anthony Albanese managed to achieve a workaround whereby they could operate their official accounts without going through a third party based in China .\nRyan says the prime minister \u2019 s office should have tried to achieve a similar solution with Tencent .\n\u201c If they didn \u2019 t do that , they \u2019 re ignoring the problem that \u2019 s staring them in the face , \u201d Ryan said .\n\u201c If they did ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving white glove treatment to the ALP.\n\u201d The PMO had not responded to our request for comment at the time of writing .\nThe difficulties with registering an account are just one of the challenges engagement with WeChat has thrown up .\nRyan believes major parties should come to a mutual agreement not to use it because of the risk of censorship and surveillance .\n\u201c Even when you do sort out all these issues , you \u2019 re still working in an environment that \u2019 s highly censored , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out , \u201d he said .\nWe have already seen instances of that .\nIn 2020 , WeChat censored a post by Morrison criticising an inflammatory tweet by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian .\nA day later , the Victorian Liberal Party had its name forcibly removed for breaking platform rules .\nOn the other hand , the potential for WeChat as a tool for politicians to speak to Australia \u2019 s 1.25 million-strong Chinese diaspora is huge .\n\u201c Many migrants receive news stories from WeChat accounts which editorialise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s very important for the diaspora to get information directly from those politicians instead.\n\u201d In the 2019 election , WeChat was very effective both a campaigning tool and a misinformation vector .\nSeveral supporters of Liberal MP Gladys Liu , who boycotted the platform yesterday , used WeChat to spread scare campaigns during the narrow race for Chisholm , an electorate with a large Chinese population .\nDespite these issues , politicians appeared happy to continue using WeChat until the latest story broke .\nNow there are calls to boycott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of how the China relationship has deteriorated since 2019 .\nYang says she can see a correlation between the anxiety around WeChat and the heightened geopolitical tensions .\nAnd according to Ryan , the way Morrison \u2019 s account was treated is indicative of Australia \u2019 s tainted image in China .\n\u201c We shouldn \u2019 t lose sight of the fact that while the core of the story is one of incompetence on behalf of the PMO , it also is illustrative of just how much Scott Morrison \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation is in the garbage bin in China , \u201d Ryan said .", "author": "Kishor Napier-Raman", "url":

the Commonwealth \u2019 s performance in response to the crisis , led by a respected former judge , a former senior health professional and a former senior bureaucrat .\nAs the government \u2019 s response to both the banking and aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal commission doesn \u2019 t mean you have to follow all its recommendations \u2014 even when you say you will .\nBut any embarrassment arising

.\nMorrison \u2019 s current staff have little of any of those ( seriously \u2014 \u201c can-do capitalism \u201d ? )\n.\nIn particular , there \u2019 s no evidence of any guiding agenda for the

less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life experience and ambition only for their own political future and more on public servants with an understanding of policy issues and a broader commitment to good policy outcomes .\nFourth , announce an end to the endless expansion of contracting out policy advice , and an investment in public sector skills .\nThe consultants you \u2019 ve wasted tens of billions of dollars on

there is only going to be one winner .\nHall finishes with a pointed and shattering \u201c Lest we forget \u201d .\nOfficial Anzac Day celebrations have had a habit of eliding Australia \u2019 s first

approaching the two-year anniversary since the first case of COVID-19 was recorded in the aged care sector and , heartbreakingly , it feels as if we are no closer to managing this crisis .\nAs a not-for-profit provider , BaptistCare exists to serve our community and protect the vulnerable older people in our care .\nOur teams have been valiantly fighting the pandemic on multiple fronts for two years , but we are exhausted , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in our community , it is in our aged care system .\nAt this moment , hundreds of aged care homes and thousands of residents are locked down due to exposures and outbreaks .\nThis means that , again , our residents have been isolated in their rooms or restricted to smaller areas of the home for weeks on end without family , without the social interaction and physical activity so essential to their well-being .\nIt means our staff have cancelled holiday plans for yet another year and are working long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leanest of teams and carrying all the heightened emotional and practical pressures that come with that .\nIn a press conference you suggested the solution was to simply \u201c push through \u201d and \u201c manage the demands in aged care facilities as best we can \u201d .\nOn this point we can not stay silent .\nHow long can we rely on the resilience and fortitude of the exceptional people working on the frontlines of aged care without proper process , resources and recognition ?\nThe simple truth is that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community expects if the situation continues and all we do is \u201c push through \u201d .\nNew battle lines must be drawn or Australian aged care risks defeat in the battle against COVID .\nThere are two fundamental things that need to change .\nFirst , we need a new playbook to manage the crisis \u2014 traditional infection control is no longer a viable strategy .\nThe government and regulators need to introduce guidance and settings to support living with COVID .\nEndlessly isolating residents in their rooms and preventing visits from friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the current health advice , this is what we must do .\nIn one situation , residents have been forced to keep to their rooms for more than 21 days .\nAged care residents who are vaccinated deserve the dignity of choice around their mobility \u2014 just like we have in the broader community .\nAnd family members are a critical partner in our care model \u2014 we can not simply remove them from the equation without serious consequences .\nSecond , frontline aged care workers must receive fair and competitive compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the biggest challenges we face today was a problem long before the pandemic arrived on Australian shores and it will continue to be a problem unless it is addressed .\nThe sector is critically underfunded , the workforce is significantly underpaid for the value of their work , and staff shortages have only been accelerated by the Omicron variant .\nWe are exploring every avenue to help shore up our teams and we are so incredibly grateful to the aged care workers who continue to show up every day and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for others .\nHowever , with the ongoing pressure of the pandemic and without increasing award wages and improving the remuneration of aged care workers , we will continue to lose valuable people and experience .\nWe can hardly expect workers to stay in aged care when their qualifications and experience will earn them more money in hospitals or in disability care .\nI write to you today because we can not keep \u201c pushing through \u201d .\nWe need change from the top and we need support from our communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly receive the standard of care and services they deserve and expect .\nWe are all getting older and we should be able to trust that there is a system that allows us to age in comfort and with dignity , wherever we live and whatever the challenges of the day .\nWe ask that through your leadership of our nation you ensure the aged care sector has the appropriate resources to push through this wave , and beyond .\nWe also ask that your government and health experts ensure that plans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged care setting remain fit for purpose as the situation evolves .\nThe aged care royal commission called out fundamental systemic flaws which have not been addressed , but in fact have been allowed to grow and fester in this pandemic .\nPlease consider the strain the system is under and the continued contribution of those hard-working individuals on the frontline .\nWe can only \u201c push through \u201d for so long .", "author": "Charles Moore", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/01/28/aged-care-open-letter-scott-morrison/", "published":

aged care residents died miserable deaths in January as a consequence of the Morrison government \u2019 s staggering failures on aged care regulation , the rollout of booster shots and its refusal to address the aged care workforce crisis .\nThe numbers are horrific , and a national disgrace : according to the government \u2019 s own figures , 389 aged care residents have perished as a result of

failed to respond to the aged care royal commission COVID report recommendation to provide additional funding so that aged care residents could continue to receive visitors .\nAnd it has failed to adopt the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair Work Commission case for a substantial pay increase to retain aged care workers in an increasingly tight labour market \u2014 something Labor \u2019 s Anthony

conservative groups got together to organise a cross-country freedom convoy , setting off from Vancouver and bound for the nation \u2019 s capital , Ottawa .\nSocial media followings and news coverage

affects only about 12,000 unvaccinated truckies countrywide .\nJust like in Canberra , the Canadian movement has evolved into something much uglier as anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists co-opted what began as a peaceful , well-intentioned protest .\nAt the weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin Dichter and Tamara Lich , told an invite-only news conference the idea was to create a \u201c logistics

they have to deal with in telling a half-truthful story .\nThe upshot is today \u2019 s disclosure is a long way from truthful .\nToday \u2019 s Australian Electoral Commission report tells us that from July 1 , 2020 , until June 30 , 2021 , $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties .\nThere are two glaring shortcomings with the methodology in this process .\nIn the first place , the information is old news .\nAnd second , at least half the donations are not revealed thanks to the so-called disclosure threshold of $ 14,300 .\nThose are bad enough , but it \u2019 s the not-so-glaring issues that should bother every Australian concerned about the health and integrity of our democracy .\nThe AEC disclosure certainly doesn \u2019 t disclose that political donations are a de facto membership fee to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia \u2014 the club of political influence .\nBut let \u2019 s face it , the \u201c health and integrity of our democracy \u201d is not something to keep most people awake at night \u2014 unless of course democracy is under threat .\nOn the current world stage , the citizens of Ukraine and Myanmar could tell us what that means .\nIn Australia by contrast we have one of the cleanest democracies in the world , underpinned by the practice of \u201c one vote one value \u201d , compulsory voting and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without interference .\nGovernments in all our jurisdictions , across three tiers of government , are made and unmade through the ballot box , as sure as the sun rises in the east .\nAs ABC investigative journalist Linton Besser pointed out recently in \u201c

failed states , the subversion of the rule of law is conspicuous .\nPolice are bribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blackmail is a viable defence strategy.\n\u201d Transparency International , the agency responsible for globally smell-testing countries for corruption , ranks Australia 17 out of 180 countries in the world on its Corruption Perception Index .\nThe UK ranks 11 and the United States 67 .\nSo if Australia is such a cleanskin nirvana , what \u2019 s all the fuss about ?\nWhat \u2019 s so wrong that we need to know any more than we do about political donations \u2014 or as I was counselled recently : \u201c Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sporting analogies and metaphors come thick and fast in Australia , wouldn \u2019 t we always want to see our team at the very top of the leader board

influence ?\nYou see , the big money-related malaise in Australian politics today is more like a silent and invisible pandemic .\nYou could even optimistically say that to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of people have ended up in hospital , and life as we know it in the lucky country is chugging along well .\nYou could say the same about politics in the US and many other capitalist democracies .\nWhile Australia is well inoculated against exposure to market-based failures , no one should think we are not at risk of going down the same slippery slope as politics in the US , where money calls the shots .\nThat is why under the existing political fundraising regime we should at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of bureaucrats about who has given what , and when they gave it .\nMake no mistake , if we simply accept the fundraising and election funding system we have , even with enhanced disclosure requirements , we will continue to go down the slippery slope called the Americanisation of Australian politics .\nIt was the American futurist Buckminster Fuller who warned : \u201c You never really change things by fighting the existing reality .\nTo change something , you build a new model that makes the existing one obsolete.\n\u201d So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraising regime .\nEven in our relatively pristine , corruption-free society we confront a trust deficit between those who govern and those who are governed .\nThe causes of the trust deficit are many and varied .\nSome are probably unfixable , such as wilful bad practice being carried out by wilful bad people .\nLet \u2019 s transition to a low value , high volume form of political fundraising \u2014 an egalitarian , democratic system of fundraising that reflects Australian values .\nIf just 2 % of the 17 million Australians eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political parties of their choice the total income would be just under $ 70 million .\nThat would democratise the fundraising process .\nPolitical parties would have

control as Liberals deny leaking texts", "content": "Scott Morrison \u2019 s attempted political reset has moved to full-scale damage control after his start of the year speech at the National Press Club yesterday was hijacked by a text message bombshell .\nThis morning , the prime minister dismissed the text as \u201c scuttlebutt \u201d \u2014 and several key NSW federal ministers denied being the minister who described him as a \u201c complete psycho \u201d to former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian .\nFor her part , Berejiklian says she has no recollection of calling the PM a \u201c horrible , horrible person \u201d .\nBut she has stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of the minister dominating political discussion \u2014 and shaping as distraction for a PM falling in the polls \u2014 Crikey joined the political whodunnit .\nIt all kicked off when Peter van Onselen , Ten \u2019 s embattled political editor , got up to question Morrison at the press club and read out a savage text exchange , allegedly between Berejiklian and the senior Liberal minister .\nMorrison \u2019 s response was a quick denial : \u201c I don \u2019 t know who you \u2019 re referring to or the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I obviously don \u2019 t agree with it , and I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s my record.\n\u201d Van Onselen followed up with more text messages during the evening news , in which Berejiklian allegedly referred to Morrison as \u201c obsessed with petty political point-scoring \u201d while lives were at stake during the bushfires .\nAccording to the unnamed minister : \u201c The mob have worked him [ Morrison ] out and think he \u2019 s a fraud.\n\u201d Berejiklian was one of the first to comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I understand there has been some commentary today concerning myself and the PM .\nI have no recollection of such messages , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Let me reiterate my very strong support for Prime Minister Morrison and all he is doing for our nation during these very challenging times .\nI also strongly believe he is the best person to lead our nation for years to come.\n\u201d That tensions between Morrison and Berejiklian is hardly a new revelation .\nTheir relationship always oscillated from frosty to begrudgingly collegial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison was enough to deflect attention from his relatively meagre policy announcements , and dominate discussion of the press club address .\nMorrison , meanwhile , hit the media rounds with gusto this morning and dismissed the revelations as pointless chatter , a distraction from his goal of getting unemployment down .\nAt a press conference he said he was \u201c not fussed \u201d about getting his office to investigate the source of the leaks .\nMeanwhile , NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet slammed the whole story as a \u201c dark day for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have news now reported from an unsubstantiated text message , I think , is terrible , \u201d he said .\nMorrison \u2019 s feigned uninterest hasn \u2019 t stopped the identity of the leaker becoming the subject of feverish rumour around Canberra .\nInitially van Onselen didn \u2019 t make it clear whether the minister was state or federal .\nSpeaking to 2GB this morning , federal Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski said he was confident the leak came from Macquarie Street , rather than Canberra .\n\u201c I just don \u2019 t believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he said .\n\u201c I just don \u2019 t believe that story.\n\u201d He called for the leaker to resign if identified .\nThere was good reason to believe the messages might have come from a state minister .\nRelations between Morrison and the NSW government haven \u2019 t always been the best .\nRight now the stoush is over preselection battles , but the federal government has also frequently clashed with NSW Treasurer Matt Kean on climate as well as economic support during the pandemic .\nAsked by 2GB \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his doing , Kean said he \u201c played no part in the ambush on the prime minister \u201d .\nLater this morning , on the triumphant radio rounds , van Onselen revealed the minister in question was federal , and said the texts were from the time of the bushfires \u2014 the last time Morrison \u2019 s approval ratings were as low as they are this week .\nCrikey asked all NSW-based federal ministers about whether they \u2019 d sent the texts .\nCommunications Minister Paul Fletcher \u2019 s office declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s office told Crikey he was \u201c absolutely not \u201d the person who leaked the email .\nEnvironment Minister Sussan Ley said any suggestions she \u2019 d sent the texts were \u201c outrageous , insulting and completely untrue \u201d .\nForeign Affairs Minister Marise Payne , who van Onselen mentioned in the preamble to his question , and is the most senior NSW moderate , hadn \u2019 t responded to requests for comment at the time of writing .", "author": "Kishor Napier-Raman",

you never will .\nBut \u201c unemployment with a three in front of it \u201d was the extent of Morrison \u2019 s vision to Australians yesterday , having spent much of his National Press Club speech claiming that , apart from a few stumbles along the way on vaccines and aged care , everything was going well for the country .\nJust as with Howard , it drew more attention to Morrison \u2019 s lack of an agenda than to his economic management skills .\nThe nearest Morrison got to any explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve as prime minister was what he called the Coalition \u2019 s \u201c broad vision \u201d : Where Australians can live the life they choose for themselves and make their own way .\nTo run their businesses , to get that job , get the skills they need to achieve their goals .\nTo own their own home , raise and educate their kids the way they want to do it , to be able to save for their retirement , not get into too much debt , and take that occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their community wherever they can , as they want to , and including taking care of their local environment .\nAnd to live in a country that is safe and secure .\nThese are what I describe as the great Australian aspirations .\nTo call it motherhood would be generous ; pabulum would be too kind .\nAnd what \u2019 s missing are minor matters like the climate emergency \u2014 please limit your environmental concerns to your local neighbourhood \u2014 Indigenous recognition and closing the gap , looking after seniors , a health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddled with corruption and extremism .\nStill , who cares about those ?\nHow to achieve the \u201c strong economy \u201d that would enable these great aspirations ?\nMorrison \u2014 like Labor \u2014 is keen on manufacturing protectionism or , to use the new jargon , \u201c sovereign manufacturing capability \u201d , because putting the word \u201c sovereign \u201d in , like inserting the word \u201c security \u201d , requires the immediate suspension of critical thought .\nManufacturing \u2019 s not exactly a Coalition strength , either politically or in the real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost more than 8 % of our manufacturing workforce , while the total workforce has grown 14 % .\nThe biggest decision of Morrison \u2019 s prime ministership was to dump the Naval Group submarine deal in favour of a vague idea of building them mostly in the US or \u2014 a remote likelihood \u2014 the UK .\nEven by its own protectionist lights , this isn \u2019 t much of a manufacturing government .\nStill , while Morrison was pointing at areas of policy failure , he committed to throwing $ 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the past two years attacking , defunding and interfering with Australia \u2019 s university sector , Morrison seemed to be saying it \u2019 s good for only one thing : generating economic growth via stronger private sector profit .\nOf course , Morrison knows better than that .\nHe knows universities are good for bringing in export income via foreign students , who in turn provide an easily exploited low-skilled workforce .\nNot that he broached the subject of wages growth at any point .\nThat \u2019 s another area of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this government .\nBut you \u2019 d have thought that given the RBA \u2014 even now , after the recent rise in inflation \u2014 continues to insist that wages growth must lift above its current pre-stagnation levels for interest rates to start rising , Morrison would have touched on the central issue of economic policy .\nBut that was absent , along with so many other things .\nIndeed , it was a speech composed almost entirely of absences , of holes where meaningful policy \u2014 hell , any policy \u2014 should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it was defined by a lack of substance , a

Morrison \u2019 s government , sworn to \u201c well and truly serve the people of Australia \u201d in that office .\nHe is paid $ 332,720 a year plus allowances .\nLabor Leader Anthony Albanese has put forward the case that Colbeck must resign or be sacked .\nIs the case made out ?\nThe case for the prosecution is summarised in a short speech Albanese posted on social media , making the following factual claims : \u2022 566 people in aged care have died since January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all 2021 \u2022 15,000 residents and 17,000 aged care workers have been infected with COVID \u2022 One quarter of shifts in aged care facilities are not being filled ( for lack of available workers ) \u2022 Residents are missing out on food and water , showers , their wounds unattended \u2022 The aged care royal commission described the sector in one word \u2014 neglect \u2014 prior to this crisis being allowed to develop .\nThe case is bolstered by specific acts and admissions by Colbeck .\nIn a Senate inquiry in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had died in aged care from COVID .\nHe didn \u2019 t know .\n( The number was 292 . )\nHe did , however , apologise because the government \u201c didn \u2019 t get everything right \u201d in its response to that point .\nOne months later , the Senate passed a censure motion against Colbeck , declaring no confidence in his handling of aged care .\nAnother month later , when the number of deaths had gone past 700 , Colbeck declared to another Senate hearing that they were tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Senate later convened a committee to inquire into the government \u2019 s handling of COVID .\nOn January 7 this year , it asked Colbeck to attend a hearing on January 14 .\nHe wrote back refusing , on the basis that \u201c diverting time and resources \u201d during the Omicron outbreak \u201c would impact the urgent and critical work \u201d of his department .\nAs it turned out , Colbeck was going to the cricket instead ; he attended the Hobart Test as a guest for three days , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that choice is that he is also the minister for sport , but that he didn \u2019 t put his sport portfolio above his aged care one , and he \u201c wasn \u2019 t just at the cricket \u2014 I continued to work\u2026 \u201d As to the allegation that aged care is in crisis , Colbeck says it is not , and was in fact performing extremely well considering the circumstances .\nNevertheless , the government has announced the formation of a taskforce to scrutinise the disproportionately high death rate in aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , I can confirm that the objective factual allegations ( deaths , boosters etc ) are true .\nThe broader allegations of neglect and lack of proper care are harder to establish , but the fact that both the aged care industry and its workers \u2019 unions are calling for the government to send the military in to help is a pretty strong indicator that a crisis is in full swing .\nThe aged care royal commission did indeed pass its interim judgment on the impact of COVID on the sector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt found the workforce was \u201c under-resourced and overworked \u201d and \u201c now also traumatised \u201d .\nCounsel assisting had submitted that it was clear on the evidence that the aged care sector had not been well prepared for COVID and not all that could be done to prepare it was done .\n\u201c The federal government , which has sole responsibility for aged care , was firmly on notice in early 2020 \u201d about the threat .\nDamningly , counsel noted at that time that on the measure of the proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care residents ( 70 % ) , Australia was \u201c one of the worst performing countries in the world \u201d .\nBetween January 1 and February 3 this year , 1749 Australians were reported to have died from COVID , 566 being aged care residents .\nThe additional number receiving aged care in their home is not recorded .\nPerhaps that \u2019 s what Colbeck means when he says the sector is performing extremely well \u2014 the proportion of aged care deaths has dropped from 70 % to one third .\nThat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that COVID is now rampant in the community , which in 2020 it was not .\nMinisters of the Crown , being public officers and carrying a commission from the Queen to serve the public interest , have heavy and unique responsibilities .\nThey also carry the most basic burden of office , the same one anyone in a position of responsibility bears : competence .\nIf that is not met , the public should rightly expect them to relinquish the role so that someone else who is competent can perform it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his watch , his portfolio responsibility has been incompetently acquitted and , in fact , neglected .\nFurther , that he has exhibited personal unwillingness or inability to take his job seriously and step up to the awesome challenge of COVID-19 as it assaulted the most vulnerable sector of the population .\nThe case is , it seems to me , unarguable .\nIf there are any standards left at all in this government , the outcome is obvious .\nShould Richard Colbeck lose his $ 332,720 a year

poor , enraged by the unconscionable hogging by a minority of most of society \u2019 s wealth , want the governance system that allowed it destroyed .\nWith no loyalty to democracy and a single-minded

-based choices .\nWhat was clear throughout the first year of the pandemic was that state and federal governments had the capacity , financially and structurally , to act collectively and , most

\u201c Will the children be hardest hit ?\n\u201d ) , fatigue and general despondency ( \u201c There is no easy way out of this \u201d ) .\nThat loss of public hope and shared optimism ( \u201c If @ @

, raises questions about Pompeo \u2019 s potential influence on Australia \u2019 s foreign policy positions , particularly in relation to China .\nKelly \u2019 s report , drawn from a new book he has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Trump administration was \u201c deeply rooted in my relationship with Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo \u201d .\nThe PM and Pompeo were in contact \u201c weekly , not necessarily on the phone , but we were regular correspondents \u201d .\nAnd the point of nexus ?\n\u201c We \u2019 re evangelical Christians , \u201d Morrison said .\nThe assertion puts paid to the idea that Morrison keeps his religion and politics separate .\nThe revelation also underlines the secretive nature of Morrison \u2019 s conduct of national affairs .\nWho knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apocalyptic Christian Pompeo were email and phone buddies during a critical phase of Australia \u2019 s relationship with China ?\nCrikey has asked Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne if she was aware of the relationship and if she had been kept informed of policy developments .\nWe did not hear back by deadline .\nThe revelation also starts to make sense of the confluence in Australian and US foreign policy in key areas .\nAs Crikey reported in our God in the Lodge series last year , Morrison \u2019 s decision to publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the origins of COVID-19 in 2020 was a neat fit with the US position .\nAnother was his sudden announcement , on the eve of a 2018 byelection for the seat of Wentworth , that Australia might shift its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , breaking with decades of careful Middle East diplomacy .\nThe idea was junked immediately but it paralleled a move by the Trump administration , made in part to please the ranks of America \u2019 s apocalyptic Christians .\nThere is no precedent for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance via constant dialogue with a US secretary of state , with or without the bonds of religion .\nThe question is : what other Australian positions might be influenced by the Pompeo-Morrison faith relationship ?\nPompeo is a Tea Party Republican and former member of the US Congress .\nHe was appointed by Trump as head of the CIA and then secretary of state from 2018 until January 2021 .\nOn the question of Israel Pompeo suggested in an interview that God may have sent President Trump to earth to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I am confident that the Lord is at work here , \u201d he added .\nPompeo \u2019 s most strident attacks , though , have been on the Chinese government and its actions against religious minorities .\nIn one speech Pompeo described the Chinese Communist Party as \u201c the gravest threat to religious freedom \u201d .\nPompeo cited what he called China \u2019 s \u201c war \u201d against Muslims , Buddhists , Christians and practitioners of the outlawed Falun Gong sect .\nJust before leaving office Pompeo escalated his rhetoric on China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population .\n( China in turn called Pompeo \u201c a doomsday clown and joke of the century \u201d who was \u201c notorious for lying and deceiving.\n\u201d ) Over the same period the United States Commission on Religious Freedom , a State Department body with Republican and Democrat appointments , alleged that the Chinese government had intensified its \u201c sinicisation \u201d of religion policy .\nIt cited \u201c credible \u201d human rights reports of \u201c organ harvesting \u201d of Falun Gong members .\nIt also cited reports that pictures of the Virgin Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Xi Jinping and \u201c robed choir members \u201d sang hymns of praise not to God but to the Chinese Communist Party .\nAfter leaving office Pompeo joined the influential conservative think tank the Hudson Institute which had authored the report on sinicisation of religion cited by the commission .\nThe last publicly known interaction between Morrison and Pompeo was in late January last year .\nThe pair reportedly spoke about the \u201c unbreakable bond \u201d that exists between the US and Australia and committed to continue working together to deepen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the importance of the Quad alliance ( between the US , Australia , Japan and India ) to \u201c advance a free , open , and inclusive Indo-Pacific region \u201d .\nAnd what of AUKUS ?\nPrecious little is known of how Australia came to suddenly cancel its submarine contract with France and plump for a US-led alliance to produce nuclear submarines .\nWhat we do know , courtesy of Morrison himself , is that he had been considering alternatives for at least two years before making his surprise announcement in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Emanuel Macron , Morrison disclosed that he had ordered an investigation after the 2019 election to examine potential alternatives to the French deal .\nWe also know that by March last year , Morrison had appointed former US Navy secretary Donald Winter as a special adviser on the subs .\nThat was six months before Morrison terminated the French deal .\nBut secrets remain , not just on the identities of those involved but the number .\nLast week Defence Minister Peter Dutton told 7.30 \u2018 s Laura Tingle that the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revoke the French contract was in the \u201c single digits.\n\u201d \u201c I mean the prime minister has been clear publicly in relation to this process \u201d , Dutton said .\n\u201c This was a compartmentalised piece of work within Defence .\nThere were very , single digits in fact , number of people who had access to what was a very high-level discussion and decision-making process within the government.\n\u201d In Kelly \u2019 s analysis Morrison has been \u201c bold \u201d in his foreign policy .\n\u201c His secret effort to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of executive decision-making that only prime ministers can pull off , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c Morrison \u2019 s instinct is for ambition and activism .\nHe rarely defers to others and puts the stamp of his style and judgments all over Australian foreign policy.\n\u201d Maybe so .\nBut how can we know ?\nThe truth is we know more about Bridget McKenzie \u2019 s dodgy $ 36,000 sports rorts grant to the Wangaratta Clay Target Club than we do about how Australia came to make the biggest defence policy change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a submarine fleet perhaps for decades .\nMoreover , as captain \u2019 s picks go , the submarine decision makes Tony Abbott \u2019 s knighthood to Prince Phillip look like an Australia Day prank .\nIt only adds to the intrigue that Morrison and Pompeo had each other secretly on speed dial for close to two years .\nIf you know more about this story , please email [ email protected ] .", "author": "David Hardaker", "url":

deep Pentecostal ties and which has since been forced to overhaul its management after an internal investigation into its past practices .\nCrikey \u2019 s investigation also reveals conflicting stories about how the grant came about .\nThe trail , though , leads directly to the prime minister .\nThe allegations include that young women attending the Esther Foundation in Perth \u2014 which offers counselling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians , were forced to read the Bible aloud as a therapy to improve concentration , and were subjected to all-night prayer and confession sessions led by the foundation \u2019 s founder and pastor , Patricia Lavater .\nA former Indigenous resident also claims she was told she had \u201c Aboriginal demons \u201d .\nOther allegations include that treatment for addiction and trauma was based on the faith healing methods of Smith Wigglesworth , a prominent figure in the history of Australian Pentecostalism .\nMorrison announced the grant in person during a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months before the 2019 election .\nHe also took personal credit for the taxpayer-funded grant , telling staff and residents : \u201c I don \u2019 t invest in things that don \u2019 t work.\n\u201d The foundation is in the electorate of Hasluck , then held by a margin of 2.1 % by cabinet minister Ken Wyatt .\nIn a seeming parallel to the sports rorts affair , the $ 4 million grant was made under the government \u2019 s Community Health and Hospitals Program ( CHHP ) , a $ 1.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison to enable direct grants from the Commonwealth \u2014 a step which health experts warned would allow the government to give priority to marginal seats .\nCrikey \u2019 s checks show that according to the public record the grant was approved by the federal Health Department under the CHHP program in June 2019 , three months after Morrison announced it .\nIt was also included in a list of CHHP projects publicly announced by Health Minister Greg Hunt .\nIn response to Crikey \u2019 s inquiries , Health said the public record was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another program after a submission made by the Esther Foundation directly to Hunt \u2019 s office in the month before the multimillion-dollar grant was announced .\nCrikey \u2019 s checks also show that the foundation received a separate federal grant of $ 630,000 in January 2019 under the Safer Communities Fund , run by the Home Affairs Department .\nThe Australian National Audit Office ( ANAO ) has been investigating the administration of the fund following reports that 90 % of funds were allocated to government-held or marginal seats before the last election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to be tabled this month .\nWho \u2014 or what \u2014 is the Esther Foundation ?\nThe foundation grew out of the work of Pentecostal pastor Phil Howell and his wife , Jeanette , who ran the New Day ministries in Perth in the mid-1990s .\nJeanette was one of its founders , and she and Phil Howells went on to establish an entity called Without Walls , billed as an \u201c apostolic and prophetic company \u201d .\nEsther Foundation , though , was to become most identified with the husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dedicated it solely to supporting young women with mental health problems and drug and alcohol addiction .\nThe Lavaters built a powerful network of connections in Perth \u2019 s business and political circles .\nFormer Liberal premier Colin Barnett was a strong supporter and was a member of its business committee .\nUnder Barnett \u2019 s government , the foundation was given access to low-cost accommodation for its growing number of residents .\nThe foundation has also operated with the support of Perth \u2019 s most influential Pentecostal churches .\nThese include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former champion tennis player turned pastor Margaret Court \u2014 a trenchant opponent of same-sex relationships \u2014 and the Globalheart megachurch which was set up by former Hillsong senior pastors Gerard and Sue Keehan .\nThe Keehan team had \u201c planted \u201d the London Christian Life Centre , which later became Hillsong London , before they arrived in Perth .\nOver the years Globalheart has become closely entwined with Liberal Party politics in Western Australia .\nTwo attendees , Albert Jacob and Jan Norberger , were MPs in the Barnett government .\nOther members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party \u2019 s Moore division and formed a powerful support base for Liberal MP Ian Goodenough when he was elected to federal Parliament in 2013 .\nOn the face of it the Esther Foundation was the success story everyone wanted to believe .\nTroubled young women and girls were having their lives turned around through its regime of Christian teaching and education and training for work opportunities .\nRod Lavater had spent several years in prison for defrauding banks and other financial institutions to feed a drug addiction .\nDescribed as a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award nominations , his rise to running the foundation as senior administrator was the very triumph-over-adversity story it has symbolised and championed .\nPatricia Lavater has received various awards for her work , including being named Western Australia \u2019 s Australian of the Year in 2008 for her community service .\nCrikey has spoken to former staff and residents who paint a different picture of what was occurring behind the scenes .\nOne former employee told Crikey : \u201c Patricia thinks she knows how to rehabilitate young people because she believes God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The organisation was poorly run .\nThere was no accountability or culpability.\n\u201d Former residents contacted by Crikey have made several allegations about what happened inside the foundation .\nThey include : \u2022 Young women and girls were expected to read the Bible every day \u2022 There was a lack of staff with professional qualifications \u2022 Residents were told they risked going to hell if they left and did not follow God \u2019 s will \u2022 At one point residents were attending five religious meetings a week .\nThe church service commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and involved such things as running up and down the room with imaginary swords for up to an hour to beat the spirit of addiction .\nThis was considered to be a treatment for addiction and it was considered residents should be better off , if not cured \u2022 Residents were told that any same-sex attraction was a lie from the devil , and was sin .\nAnyone who was LGBTIQ was forced to undergo a form of gay conversion .\nIf a resident was known to have feelings towards another woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other and would be forced to repent of their thoughts and feelings for each other , often publicly .\nBy late 2019 \u2014 six months after Morrison announced the $ 4 million grant \u2014 the Esther Foundation success story started to unravel .\nA new CEO investigated the backlog of complaints .\nAs a result the foundation and its founder , Patricia Lavater , parted ways .\nIn its annual report , the foundation publicly downplayed the extent of the problems it had uncovered .\nIn a careful statement it referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d while it \u201c transitioned from the old to the new \u201d .\nThere was \u201c the realisation between us all \u201d that it was \u201c time for everyone to embark on a new adventure \u201d .\n\u201c We gratefully build on the legacy of all the best aspects of what this organisation has significantly grown into since the mid-1990s under [ Patricia Lavater \u2019 s ] leadership , \u201d a statement said .\nHowever , a statement prepared in the name of Patricia Lavater for \u201c friends and family \u201d of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated to a small group , excluding corporate sponsors , almost a year to the day after Morrison \u2019 s visit .\n\u201c There were mistakes made in the time I was managing director and I am aware of complaints having been raised about the way things were done , \u201d her statement said .\n\u201c I own the responsibilities of the mistakes and wrongs that were done on my watch .\nI know that the Lord has a new season for me as well as some time of contemplation .\n\u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life that are weak and allowing the Lord in his mercy to bring change to those areas .\n\u201c The Lord will never forsake us as we look to him .\nHe is a gracious God and a God of second chances .\nI am asking the Lord for a clear vision for the next stage of my journey and to be connected with what He wants for me .\n\u201c Esther is on the Lord \u2019 s heart and He loves the broken that come through these doors even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let your hearts be troubled but rely on Him .\nThe Lord is with you , mighty warriors !\n\u201d Crikey has also confirmed that a number of former residents took their complaints to the West Australian Police before Patricia Lavater left .\nSpeaking to Crikey , Patricia Lavater denied the foundation was opposed to homosexuality .\n\u201c It didn \u2019 t matter what the relationship was , the girls were told they couldn \u2019 t have any relationships while they were on the ( treatment ) program .\nIt wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to drive out \u201c Aboriginal spirits \u201d through dance : \u201c We did dance around using the moves one girl gave us but that was for fun.\n\u201d Lavater agreed that young women had run around with swords to cut their addiction but insisted that was a symbolic act .\nThe burning of possessions , too , was symbolic \u2014 but applied only to stolen goods the girls might have brought in .\nChurch services might have gone on for a long time , but this was likely because \u201c the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLavater conceded that some allegations made to Crikey might be true but suggested this might be because of staff who weren \u2019 t qualified : \u201c A lot of the girls who were successful under the program stayed on as staff and weren \u2019 t qualified , and I wan \u2019 t always there.\n\u201d On the question of coercion to read the Bible , Lavater said the foundation \u2019 s program was \u201c Bible-based \u201d and that perhaps \u201c some of the girls felt like they didn \u2019 t want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it \u2019 s good for a leader to admit making mistakes , \u201d she told Crikey .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to take away from the people who want to be heard.\n\u201d So what of the foundation \u2019 s methods now ?\nIn an emailed response the Esther Foundation said that for more than 25 years it had played \u201c a vital role in assisting women through trauma and crisis situations including addiction and domestic violence \u201d .\n\u201c The current executive staff of the foundation can not comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that occurred in the past before they were employed , \u201d it read .\n\u201c These allegations were made against a former MD who left two years ago .\nWe can state categorically that the Esther Foundation is now operated under best practice principles and our focus is on helping all participants in their journey to restoration.\n\u201d The foundation \u2019 s new board remains dominated by evangelical and Pentecostal church members .\nSince Patricia Lavater left , it uses the \u201c Celebrate Recovery \u201d program , a 12-step \u201c Christ-focused \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pioneered in the United States .\nThe foundation says adopting Celebrate Recovery \u2014 which claims it is \u201c part of a movement that God is blessing \u201d \u2014 should help \u201c strengthen our credibility with the government and corporate stakeholders \u201d .\nIt also draws on the Bible-based teachings of American Christians Dr John Townsend and Dr Henry Cloud on how to set personal boundaries .\nNext : How did a Pentecostal foundation get a $ 4 million grant from Scott Morrison ?\nAnd why ?", "author": "David Hardaker", "url":

for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 [ It ] turned out to be a nightmare.\n\u201d There appeared to be tears from survivors and Higgins left shortly after Greens leader Adam Bandt began speaking .\nThe acknowledgment was recommended by sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins in her report into parliamentary workplaces , which found 51 % of people employed in Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces had experienced some form of bullying , assault or sexual harassment , and one in three had experienced some form of sexual harassment .\nMorrison \u2019 s apology , while seemingly genuine , focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workforce and struggles to retain and attract talent , but Labor leader Anthony Albanese went further .\n\u201c While the report concerns itself with this place , it is

.\nHiggins , Potter , Rachelle Miller and other survivors weren \u2019 t initially invited to the apology \u2014 COVID-19 restrictions were blamed \u2014 and they once again relied on media coverage

was also agreed to around the [ email protected ] report .\nSupport for those recommendations was quietly walked back so that just six of the 16 recommendations were passed in Parliament .\nThe day

Dutton was also the psycho-caller , or what van Onselen had said was wrong .\nDutton responded via Twitter saying Carr \u2019 s tweet was \u201c baseless , untrue and should be deleted \u201d .\nCarr doubled down , calling on Dutton to get another minister to admit to being the source , or else concede that it was him .\nCarr also told media that his source for the Dutton-naming was \u201c a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a case ?\nIn Carr \u2019 s first tweet he made a direct factual allegation that Dutton leaked the text .\nHe didn \u2019 t say that Dutton wrote it and , because that \u2019 s only one of two possible explanations for who did , the tweet doesn \u2019 t convey that allegation .\nSo all it says about Dutton is that he leaks and that he \u2019 s trying to undermine the prime minister because he wants to replace him .\nWell , the last part of that is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , and might already be if he could count .\nAnd he \u2019 s not averse to undermining his leader \u2014 ask

challenging proposition .\nThe second Carr tweet really adds nothing , apart from aggravation .\nWhat Carr says \u2014 that Dutton couldn \u2019 t win a defamation case unless he can finger another

truth is on the defendant ( Carr ) .\nAnd truth is the only defence Carr would have available , if sued .\nHe \u2019 d have to prove that Dutton was van Onselen \u2019 s source .\nWhich would be difficult , since according to what he \u2019 s been saying , Carr doesn \u2019 t have any direct proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s picked it up second- or third-hand from someone in the media .\nAwkward .\nStill

\u2019 s why .\nSharma tells Crikey he made a commitment when first running in 2018 that he believed schools being able to discriminate against gay and trans children was wrong .\n\u201c Last night I had the opportunity to right this historic wrong and fix a piece of legislation which authorised such discrimination in a way that was causing distress to countless individuals and families , and was out of step with community values , \u201d he said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support this change , which I believe they do in principle , but they were not quite ready to do so .\nI respect that difference of opinion , but I had to keep faith with my own electorate and my own conscience on this issue.\n\u201d Allen , a paediatrician who has been chair of council of a faith-based school and on the board of a faith-based hospital , says her view remains clear .\n\u201c All children , no matter who they are , deserve an education and our support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this should be protected irrespective of sexual orientation or gender identity .\nThat is why I voted for an amendment in the Sex Discrimination Act to do just that .\nWe must always value and protect our individual freedoms , but not at the expense of children .\nI know this value is widely shared across Higgins .\n\u201c Having secured this amendment to protect all children , I have and will continue to support the religious discrimination legislation to ensure it is in the best possible place to support those of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister and the attorney-general for their hard work to accommodate the broad range of views expressed by Australians in order to bring us together in pursuit of more love and less hate.\n\u201d Archer has long been critical of the bill .\nShe tells Crikey she was \u201c utterly distressed \u201d by the government \u2019 s decision to exclude children who identify as transgender as part of its amendment to protect gay students .\n\u201c All children have the right to live their life and to be themselves without the worry of bullying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , where they should always feel safe and valued .\n\u201c To specifically exclude transgender students from the original amendment is cruel and I have no doubt it would lead to higher rates of self-harm and poor mental health .\n\u201c I am always going to do what I can to protect children from harm and this resolve has been strengthened by the hundreds of calls , messages and emails from young people and their loved ones who are anxious and frightened by the possibility of Australia becoming a less inclusive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament , Liberal backbencher Zimmerman , who is gay , said despite being in a supportive environment he had struggled to come to terms with his sexuality .\n\u201c There are people today that are in anguish because of their sexuality , and there are even more people in anguish because of their gender , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We have to provide a legal environment that supports them and part of that is ensuring when they \u2019 re going to school , to an educational institution , they do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but knowing at the very least that that school can not legally discriminate against them.\n\u201d Martin said : \u201c People of faith should not be discriminated against because of their beliefs , nor should children be put in harm

clinking glasses with Morrison ( those small beers that public figures have when they want to appear like men of the people ) in a pub in The Real Australia .\nSuch an approach is far more defensible if it creates a relaxed atmosphere that in turn elicits a genuine revelation from the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think Scott and Jenny \u2019 s two-week break-up when they were teenagers tells us anything about the Morrison government \u2019 s policies .\nPolitical theatre like this is a zero sum game \u2014 letting Jenny speak about Grace Tame \u2019 s lack of civility when they met a few weeks ago ( the eyes narrow , the smile is undimmed , the word \u201c disappointing \u201d is used a lot ) burns through airtime that could be used to ask about , say , whether Jen has ever spoken to Marise Payne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( certainly , no one else seems to have ) .\nBut of course that would be a political question , and Jenny hates politics .\nThe end result is a revolving door of logic \u2014 she stands in front of Morrison as a shield or looms behind him as a halo ; she is responsible for his greatest political misstep , yet she is an apolitical figure ; she leads in the interview and hates the attention .\nAnd round and round it goes .", "author": "Charlie Lewis", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/02/14/politics-through-a-funhouse-mirror-with-jenny-and-the-kids/",

tested political marketing ploy .\nScott Morrison , facing accusations of being a psycho and having a general lack of human-like traits , desperately needed an image reset .\nIt \u2019 s the classic \u201c wheel in the wife \u201d strategy , where a political partner is brought in to normalise the PM and provide a character witness to say , hey , he \u2019 s not so bad after all .\nBut just how have the spouses through Australia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few different approaches\u2026 Last night Jenny Morrison provided a \u201c woman \u2019 s touch \u201d to soften Morrison \u2019 s image as a calculated and ruthless political player , and to say things Morrison simply couldn \u2019 t .\nIn a message to the \u201c quiet Australians \u201d who probably aren \u2019 t as enamoured of Grace Tame \u2019 s side-eye as some , Jenny lamented her lack of manners .\nShe took the blame for the Hawaii decisions and and rationalised Morrison \u2019 s infamous \u201c Jenny has a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brittany Higgins rape allegations .\nThe last time we saw a PM and their partner on 60 Minutes it was Julia Gillard and Tim Mathieson .\nAbout a year into her prime ministership , Gillard \u2014 our first and only female prime minister \u2014 and Mathieson sat down so Australians could get to know the so-called first bloke .\nAlthough apparently it wasn \u2019 t easy to get them into the studio , the interview served to unravel some of the mystery surrounding Gillard \u2019 s private life , and softened her image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship .\nAustralia has seen a number of prime ministerial marriages where the wife is just as qualified as the man in the top job , if not more so .\nTake Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull .\nA politician in her own right as the former lord mayor of Sydney , she has held a range of prominent positions in a long career .\nDuring Turnbull \u2019 s prime ministership they occasionally did media interviews together , but for the most part it was just loving , respectful mentions by Turnbull of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Janette Howard : always at John \u2019 s side on the campaign trail , she was a political force .\nAlthough she largely kept silent publicly , Howard biographer Pru Goward said she \u201c lives and breathes politics \u201d .\nShe apparently played an active role in Howard \u2019 s deliberations and electoral work .\nAnd then there was Kevin Rudd and Therese Rein .\nRein was a successful entrepreneur , and was the first PM \u2019 s spouse to stay in the workforce throughout the gig .\nShe was a loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more popular than her husband in the end .\nGoing back in time a bit , Gough and Margaret Whitlam were the original political power couple .\nThe Whitlams stuck together through door-knocking in his early campaigns , all the way to the top job in Canberra .\nShe was the first Australian political wife to openly give her views and appear heavily in campaigns .\nWe don \u2019 t know much about Annita Keating or Margie Abbott \u2014 whether because of a hatred of politics or of the spotlight they elected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet wife was Hazel Hawke , although she probably falls under the \u201c long-suffering \u201d category given the long-running affairs of husband Bob .\nPerhaps part of the strategy of centring Jenny in this campaign is to highlight the fact that Anthony Albanese is not married .\nWhile people continue to wonder who Albanese is , he doesn \u2019 t have a wife to wheel out to explain that he is human after all .\nAt the closing of 60 Minutes last night an Albanese profile was promised for the coming weeks .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same strategy as Morrison , maybe he \u2019 ll debut his new partner .\nAfter all , a loving spouse never goes astray on the campaign trail .\nApparently .\nIs bringing out the spouse a fair enough ploy or does it make you feel a little ill ?\nLet us know your thoughts by writing to [ email protected ] .\nPlease include your full

Government grilled in Senate estimates", "content": "Forget national apologies and soft interviews with Jenny Morrison .\nThe Coalition has a real opportunity to prove it cares about women ahead of the federal election : the budget .\nThe government has been grilled on its commitment to gender equality in a Senate estimates hearing , with Minister for Women Marise Payne and Workplace Gender Equality Agency director Mary Wooldridge questioned in a rapid-fire 45-minute session .\nA key area of concern was the 2022 budget , set to be released this month .\nWhile the 2020 budget was slammed for being \u201c paltry \u201d and \u201c tokenistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating effects on the economy \u2014 with many women on the frontlines in the care economy \u2014 the 2021 budget was a huge improvement .\nWhat will the 2022 budget hold ?\nIn 2020 , the Coalition \u2019 s line was that women also benefitted from the budget because they too accessed tax cuts ( though , due to lower average earnings , benefitted less than men ) , were aided by business cash splashes , and used roads .\nThey wheeled this line out again on Sunday , with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited the most from tax cuts .\n\u201c Young Australian women aged between 25 and 34 have seen the amount of tax paid decline by 15 % , \u201d his office said , adding that changes to childcare will also boost the disposable income of Australian women .\nGreens Senator Larissa Waters asked whether this year the government will produce a gender-lens analysis of the budget .\nThe women \u2019 s budget statement , which examined how budget decisions affected women , was abandoned in 2014 by former minister for women Tony Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossy document \u201d \u2014 a supporting statement outlining impacts .\nWaters called for a gender-lens analysis instead of \u201c working out what it means after the decisions were made by mostly a bunch of dudes \u201d .\nWhat about the gender pay gap ?\nIn questioning Frydenberg \u2019 s line about tax cuts for women , Wooldridge was asked about measures taken to support the systemic drivers of the gender pay gap .\nForty per cent of the gender gap is due to participation in the workforce , with women entering lower-paid roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often for childcare \u2014 while the other 40 % is due to bias and discrimination .\nThere \u2019 s been a fractional improvement in the gender pay gap , but things still aren \u2019 t good : for every $ 10 a man earned , a woman made about $ 7.72 , as found by the latest report by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency ( WGEA ) .\nWomen typically earn about $ 25,000 a year less than men ; men are twice as likely as women to earn more than $ 120,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of women are employed in part-time or casual roles .\nWooldridge said WGEA hadn \u2019 t spent much time working in policy but hoped to in the future , and said that the office would focus on working with companies to facilitate the economic participation of women .\nThe government , she revealed , doesn \u2019 t collect data on how many contracts it procures from women-led businesses .\nAustralia ranks 50th out of 156 countries on the 2021 Global Gender Gap Index , falling from 15th place in 2006 .\nAustralia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 70th in 2021 for economic participation and opportunity , though ranks first for educational attainment for women .\nAnd on reducing violence and harassment ?\nA report into former education minister Alan Tudge , who has been stood aside , was handed to the government 17 days ago , with no action taken .\nThe report looks into his conduct following allegations he was abusive to former staffer Rachelle Miller , who was in a consensual romantic relationship with him .\nMiller alleged Tudge was emotionally abusive and on one occasion physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTudge denies the allegations and will contest the next federal election .\nThe investigation report was hand-delivered to Scott Morrison on January 28 , a Senate committee heard , because it was \u201c particularly sensitive \u201d .\nMiller declined to participate in the inquiry .\nIt \u2019 s unknown whether it will be made public .\nIn a historic speech at the National Press Club last week , Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins called for more action on violence against women and children .\nTame said the government needed to engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal education on the grooming process , and provide a \u201c consistent national framework that supports survivors and their loved ones , not just in their recovery , but also to disempower and deter predators from action \u201d .\nTame also revealed the government spent just 11 cents per student per year on education aimed at preventing sexual abuse and assault .\nPayne was asked in estimates whether she believed the funding levels were adequate .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have all of the state and territory funding arrangements with me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the funding would be reviewed based on demand and abuse .\nThe government has faced criticism for the new National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children , with advocates saying the plan lacked clear , measurable targets .\nPayne couldn \u2019 t say whether the targets would be revised , whether the draft would be made public before the election , or whether consultation reports guiding the draft , produced by Monash University , would also be publicly released .\nIn a previous hearing , Labor Senator Jenny McAllister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Meg Brighton about support for parliamentary staffers following sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins \u2019 report , Set the Standard .\nBrighton said the new

way the girls were treated\u2019: Esther residents speak out", "content": "This is part six in a series .\nFor the rest of the series , go here .\nMore women who underwent treatment at the Esther Foundation have come forward with first-hand accounts of religion-based abuse during their years as residents of the Pentecostal-linked facility which has received millions of dollars in grants from the Morrison government .\nThe former residents , who as teenagers were in rehab for addiction and mental health issues , have raised disturbing new allegations including : \u2022 Residents were told to \u201c pray the demons \u201d out of themselves , rather than receive professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c pray the pain away \u201d , rather than be given pain medication \u2022 They were subjected to a form of exorcism which , on one account , ended with residents speaking in tongues to rid a teenage girl of the devil , as another resident read from a Bible \u2022 Residents who gave trouble might be kept locked in a room for hours \u2022 A senior Esther figure known as \u201c Prophet Caren \u201d was said to hear messages direct from God and convey these to individual girls \u2022 Residents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual spirits \u201d and raped in the outside world if they left the Esther facility .\nThe allegations come on top of claims made last week by former resident Lydia Taylor , a young Indigenous woman who told Crikey that Esther staff attempted to drive out \u201c Aboriginal demons \u201d from her .\nTaylor broke a decades-long silence around Esther House , the facility operated by the Esther Foundation .\nHer allegations have prompted others to go on the record .\nIn the case of the Esther Foundation that \u2019 s a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patricia Lavater , has been widely honoured for her work in rehabilitating young women .\nShe has a formidable network of church , business and political supporters and a devoted following of young Christian women coming to her defence .\nFor all that , some of the strongest criticism of Esther House comes from someone once closest to Lavater .\nBonnie , who wanted Crikey to only use her first name , was raised in Esther House from the age of five , the daughter of a heroin-addicted mother who moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavater through the church .\nLavater became godmother to Bonnie and had Bonnie live in her home rather than in the house for residents .\nBonnie says she was grateful to Lavater for helping her mother and that Lavater had helped many people \u2014 but there was \u201c a lot of stuff \u201d she didn \u2019 t agree with .\n\u201c Esther House was 100 % about control , \u201d she says .\n\u201c Patricia and [ husband ] Rod ran the shop .\nSo it \u2019 s hard .\nPatricia herself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut Esther House is a whole other thing .\n\u201c The way things were done was wrong \u2014 not appropriate .\nI have said for a very long time that I have wanted to speak about it because it \u2019 s disgusting the way the girls were treated .\n\u201c If you were gay they would give you exorcisms until there was no lesbian in you .\nAnd it was hard-core praying and Bible bashing until you were on the floor , on your knees screaming .\n\u201c I was locked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bible for six hours , all because of something to do with chocolate , I don \u2019 t know .\nBut apparently the wrong thing.\n\u201d For Bonnie the final straw came when Lavater refused to allow her to leave Esther House to see her mother when her mother was diagnosed with cancer and had been given a short time to live .\n\u201c A 16-year-old girl being told your mum \u2019 s got cancer and you can \u2019 t see her ?\nWell , what \u2019 s that ?\n\u201d she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back .\nFifteen years on she remains deeply conflicted about Lavater , who she thinks of as \u201c a Christian type of hippie \u201d but who was a different person when it came to God and running Esther House .\nThen it became all about control and Lavater \u2019 s beliefs .\n\u201c You \u2019 re not allowed to have another belief , \u201d she says .\n\u201c It \u2019 s their belief , nobody else \u2019 s belief .\nIt \u2019 s like smashing it in your face .\nEven when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t allowed to sit down , you had to stand up .\nThere was no sitting down at all.\n\u201d Bonnie \u2019 s mixed feelings are similar to those of other women Crikey has spoken to .\nThe unifying thought , though , is that the truth must be told of what happened behind the walls of Esther House .\nFor some it is about being believed and coming to terms with the trauma they say they have lived with from their time there .\nSome want Esther closed completely , regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure of Lavater in 2020 as former residents approached Western Australian police with their stories .\nBut it is also about making sure that rehabilitation for those with mental health and addiction problems is not again left in the hands of people who believe the answers lie in the Bible and who are supported by politicians and other public figures keen to bask in the glow of lives \u2014 apparently \u2014 being turned around .\nResponding to the new allegations before publication , Patricia Lavater said she \u201c deeply \u201d apologised \u201c for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals \u201d .\nAs we continue our series we will publish more first-hand accounts and seek answers from state and federal authorities on how the Esther phenomenon prospered for so long .\nNext : Claire Crawford and how she escaped

.\nTwo weeks ago it brought forward the closure dates for both , to 2033 at the latest for Bayswater and 2045 for Loy Yang A .\nBoth will close much sooner .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so .\nThat \u2019 s

"For those following the now seemingly irreversible destruction of American democracy over the past six years , the confected kerfuffle in Australia \u2019 s Parliament last week over the threat of foreign influence in our elections was eerily familiar .\nAmericans didn \u2019 t learn until after the 2016 election that Russia was targeting their democracy by helping Donald Trump to win the US presidency .\nNow , as the leaders of Australia \u2019 s two major parties face off in Parliament just months before a federal election , each was accusing the other of being \u2014 or harbouring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nAs always , and importantly , a basic check of such claims reveals them as farce .\nBoth the ABC and The Sydney Morning Herald were quick with the fact that there \u2019 s no daylight between the approach of both parties when it comes to China .\nASIO says both sides of politics have been targets of foreign influence operations , which in the next five years will supplant terrorism as Australia \u2019 s biggest security threat .\nThat should be the end of it .\nBut it won \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of democratic decline in other Rupert Murdoch-infested democracies is any guide .\nInstead the stoush will become just more fodder for the mill of hyper-partisanship that , while a boon for clicks and ratings , brings democracy to its knees .\nWhy does hyper-partisanship spell death for democracy ?\nBecause it is just another word for tribalism , the intensely emotional loyalty that , while ( relatively ) harmless when applied to football teams , makes the peaceful transfer of power \u2014 one of democracy \u2019 s many gifts \u2014 impossible .\nHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the resources to which it gives access , to a tribe you \u2019 ve been convinced has no legitimate claim to hold it ?\nAnd whom you don \u2019 t trust to use it in the national interest and not against you ?\nThe short answer is you can \u2019 t , which is why the transfer of power to then president-elect Joe Biden in January didn \u2019 t happen peacefully \u2014 and almost didn \u2019 t happen at all .\nIndeed , as the authors of How Democracies Die , Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracies rely on two basic norms to function : respect and restraint .\nRespect requires parties to \u201c accept one another as legitimate rivals \u201d and ( I would add ) as victors .\nRestraint imposes a moral expectation that those granted the awesome powers of government will act lawfully and use them only to serve the public interest , not partisan or personal ones .\nIn his book Insurgency The New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters says America \u2019 s democratic unravelling began with tensions inside the Republican Party between the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious and working class majority .\nSuch \u201c hard-hats \u201d resented the way the \u201c blue-bloods \u201d hogged party leadership positions , dismissed the negative impact of globalisation on jobs and belittled conservative \u201c values \u201d ( read : racial and gender-based prejudices ) .\nWhatever the cause , the alliance at Fox of former Richard Nixon staffer Roger Ailes and billionaire Murdoch provided a legitimating platform \u2014 amplified by the internet \u2014 for those breaking every rule of the civilised debate democracy needs to function .\nThe reliance on facts and reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prohibition of ad hominem attacks ?\nGone !\nThe requirement of consistency ?\nHasta la vista , baby !\nWhich takes us to now \u2014 not just in the US but here in Australia where we are experiencing

Palmer masks a pretty standard set of rich-guy reactionary ideas behind a facade of goofiness .\nThe goofiness helps endear him to a particular class of disengaged voter who rightly views mainstream

a very long time .\nIn the 1980s , he was a Nationals state director in Queensland , helping Joh Bjelke-Petersen \u2019 s government win elections .\nA dose of old political nous coupled with an obscene , bottomless well of cash can go a long way .\nWhen the UAP \u2019 s $ 80 million ad blitz failed to deliver it a single seat at the 2019 election , some pundits wrote it off as a wasted investment .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s primary vote in parts of NSW and Queensland , and helped cement a narrative of Bill Shorten \u2019 s shiftiness that paved Scott Morrison \u2019 s return to the Lodge .\nIt \u2019 s what makes the latest iteration of Palmer so worrying .\nSince the pandemic hit in 2020 , he \u2019 s opposed COVID restrictions , vaccines and vaccine mandates , and has emerged as a vector of disinformation .\nHe \u2019 s made former Liberal MP and conspiracy theorist Craig Kelly party leader .\nDespite Australia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to tap into a muddled rump of malcontents \u2014 COVID deniers , anti-vaxxers , far-right grifters \u2014 the kind that make up the ranks of UAP \u2019 s candidate list and who descended on Canberra in their thousands .\nIt \u2019 s a small , vocal rabble .\nBut in a tight election where the only constant is Palmer \u2019 s money \u2014 he \u2019 s already spending 100 times more than the major parties on

presented by people whose gender is not what the Liberal Party and ( almost ) all churches insist God assigned to them .\nAt least , that \u2019 s what the prime minister seems to think , given the

did that in December , before acting in February to ensure that trans kids would continue to be discriminated against .\nIt \u2019 s hard to keep up with him .\nAnyway , yesterday Morrison took a short break from demonstrating trade skills to elevate an obscure backbencher \u2019 s private member \u2019 s bill to national prominence , describing Liberal Senator Claire Chandler \u2019 s attempt to ban trans athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific \u201d and pledging his support .\nThe bill was tabled during the recent , brief parliamentary sittings .\nLike all other attempted legislation this year , it will not become law before the election , and will sink without trace afterwards .\nWhy , then , the pantomime of prime ministerial emphasis for this urgent social reform ?\nAccording to Chandler , her bill addresses an urgent problem : the imminent demise of women \u2019 s sport .\nThe reason is the Sex Discrimination Act , which she says needs a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport and sporting activity can be carried out on the basis of sex and it will not be a breach of the act to do so \u201d .\nThat is , excluding trans athletes from sex-specific competition will be a specifically lawful form of discrimination .\nChandler told Parliament that \u201c the default position under the current interpretation of the act is that it is unlawful to exclude males from women \u2019 s sport , with the onus placed on administrators to prove that an exemption applies each and every time a male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s competition .\nFemale players and athletes therefore have no certainty that despite having registered for a women \u2019 s competition , they will not be required to compete against males.\n\u201d That is , of course , nonsense , but it clarifies what we \u2019 re really talking about here .\nThe clue is in the Senator \u2019 s use of \u201c male \u201d as a pejorative .\nThe fact is that there is no epidemic of men forcing themselves on women \u2019 s sporting competitions .\nWhat is happening more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people wanting to play sport .\nHigh-profile examples , such as AFL player Hannah Mouncey , abound .\nThey \u2019 re not \u201c male \u201d unless you insist that every person \u2019 s gender is assigned , biologically , at birth ; that it is unchangeable by a law of nature ; that it is binary ; that the person has no agency in the question .\nIt \u2019 s a simple position , exemplified by Morrison \u2019 s statement three years ago : \u201c We do not need \u2018 gender whisperers \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids.\n\u201d Kids being , by immutable definition , a boy or a girl .\nChandler \u2019 s bill would reinsert definitions of \u201c man \u201d and \u201c woman \u201d in the act ( they were taken out in 2013 ) , applying biological determinism to all of us once more .\nThe law would reflect the Liberal Party \u2019 s preference : that gender is binary and fixed , not up for discussion .\nThere are two problems with this : it \u2019 s scientifically untrue ( gender is not binary ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational justification for insisting that a person \u2019 s gender is something in which they have no personal say .\nBoth problems run parallel to the ( bizarrely ) continuing debate over the right of gay people to exist .\nIt is a fact that there are extremely challenging issues for sport in dealing with trans competitors , as I \u2019 ve discussed previously .\nAt root , those challenges come from the embedded cultural assumption that the world is gender-binary , and our discomfort with moving away from that understanding .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to get over that and deal with the reality .\nFor most people , it \u2019 s an issue of extremely low order .\nFor trans people , it \u2019 s about

uncertain times \u201d extensively in Parliament last week , but his attempts to paint Labor as Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) sympathisers ranged from tenuous to straight up hypocritical .\nNow the unfolding situation in Ukraine will likely provide a redirect for a national security election .\nThe threat of \u201c a new world order \u201d led by allied superpowers Russia and China may provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s pitch .\nThe \u201c children overboard \u201d affair saw immigration minister Philip Ruddock claim on the eve of the election campaign that asylum seekers on a boat off the coast had threatened to throw their children overboard .\nThe claim was later found to be false , and evidence suggested the government knew this before the election .\nAnd yet this political stunt sealed the deal for the tough-on-borders strategy .\nDesperation could lead to Morrison making a similar play to convince Australia of the threat he is trying to sell .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more capable of facing up to the international threats than the weak alternative provided by opposition leader Kim Beazley .\nWe \u2019 ve already seen this play utilised extensively to discredit Anthony Albanese , and it \u2019 s no coincidence that the term \u201c little \u201d was tossed across the floor in Parliament last week , with allusions even made to Albanese \u2019 s shorter stature .\nWill a national security ploy still work in 2022 ?\nTimes are a-changing , and 2022 is a very different world to 2001 .\nEven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it work , there \u2019 s no assurances Australia will respond in the

looking for a strong leader to get us through the hard times , Morrison \u2019 s character may have been too damaged for him to be that source of comfort .\n\u201c He came in with almost no agenda , other than tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a succession of negative stories that reflect poorly on his personal character.\n\u201d Kenny also thinks it won \u2019 t be as easy a ploy to pull off this time around : \u201c Labor is much more attuned to this now , and is being very careful to remain in lockstep with the government .\nAnd that makes it harder for the government to articulate a separate position and to prosecute the argument that Labor is somehow weak on national security.\n\u201d Finally , while Morrison will be attempting to capitalise , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world had never seen an event like 9/11 before , the Ukraine crisis has been bubbling away slowly for years .\n\u201c Depending on how the situation unfolds , the government is in danger of looking shrill as we saw last week when they

policy vision is discovered amid the rubble", "content": "When you set out to argue that Scott Morrison has a consistent and long-term foreign policy approach , you \u2019 re setting yourself a high bar .\nScomo truly enough said that his instincts had \u201c always been domestic \u201d , and just about his first pronouncement on worldly matters was that the Australian embassy in Israel should be moved to Jerusalem ( during Dave Sharma \u2019 s campaign to regain Wentworth ) .\nThis policy had been a wholly American obsession , but ScoMo went there anyway , causing uproar among our Arab friends .\nNot bad for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ScoMo has a talent for disaster , but that doesn \u2019 t deter him from searching for Morrison \u2019 s mission \u2014 a project which leaves one with the feeling that it has been written with a specific form and conclusion in mind , one which could then not be found in the material .\nTen years ago , Kelly wrote a paper for the Lowy Institute titled The Howard Agenda , concerning the foreign policy of a man who came to personal and political maturity as a conviction conservative during the Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last period of unquestioned dominance by the US .\nIt was to be expected that a consistent , reflective , thought-through foreign policy could be found .\nMorrison \u2019 s Mission is an attempt to do the same with a Gen-X , former child TV actor , happy clappy tourism industry flak and inner-party factionalist whom many Australians believe to be a fantasist or a pathological liar , at a time when the US , our oldest ally , pitches four-yearly between isolationism and renewed multilateralism , and our essential trading partner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial evidence against .\nThe whole middle of Kelly \u2019 s book on ScoMo \u2019 s allegedly deliberate foreign policy concerns his shift towards a careful but principled stand against China \u2019 s authoritarianism and regional dominance , all done in the Australian national interest \u2014 and in the meantime , Morrison , at the dispatch box , accuses the opposition leader of being a Chinese agent and his deputy a Manchurian candidate .\nThose events would matter less if Kelly were not so intent on constructing a form of authorship of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attributing it to the planet-sized brain of the prime minister .\n\u201c From the beginnings of his prime ministership , Scott Morrison was driven by the dynamic of a world being transformed , \u201d Kelly writes .\nDoes anyone without a book to put together believe that ?\nFrom the moment he was installed by his party , Scott Morrison appears to have been driven by tactics alone on the domestic front , let alone in the field of international relations .\nI suspect that even those who will vote unhesitatingly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing so for his strategic vision .\nMorrison came to power in 2018 , at a time when the post-1991 global system was truly breaking down .\nChina had turned from an inward , authoritarian form of state capitalism to a globally projected , nationalist neo-Stalinism ; the US , under Donald Trump , was juddering between crude protectionism , NATO refusal and weird attachments to the planet \u2019 s most cartoonish dictators .\nTrump had cancelled the anti-China Trans-Pacific Partnership , and Asia was in disarray .\nFor decades , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow there was a major disjunct between trade and security .\nThis was a time when we needed a prime minister capable of stepping back from the fray and speaking after careful thought .\nWhat we got was a government willing to moralise to China without being in a position to back it up , from the unilateral call for a global inquiry into China \u2019 s handling of the COVID-19 virus to the Pacific \u201c step-up \u201d , in which we \u201c warned \u201d Pacific nations that China \u2019 s investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western investment ! )\nto chivvying away on human rights , as we continued to ship iron-rich chunks of the continent their way .\nChina responded by selective and sudden tariffs on specific products such as barley , quite possibly chosen with reference to Coalition marginal electorates .\nKelly is more than willing to acknowledge that Morrison \u2019 s approach has been blundering in particular , but he argues there was a long-term intent : \u201c Morrison \u2019 s China journey from 2018 to 2021 was a wild ride .\nAlong the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic mistakes , but long run strategic intent , \u201d Kelly writes .\nYou coulda fooled us , many will say .\nKelly does not spare Morrison or his government for their blunders , but his claim to an actual direction relies on his having interviewed those around Morrison and on a single long interview with the PM himself .\nBut that \u2019 s where it gets murky .\nThroughout the book , Kelly claims thoughts on behalf of Morrison whose provenance is unclear : \u201c the Quad offered some of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted more collaboration from regional nations\u2026 \u201d But is this something Morrison said in his interview ?\nA surmise by Kelly ?\nNothing appears in the footnotes , so how does he know ?\nSo it occurs throughout .\nKelly \u2019 s basic rhetorical strategy is to make Morrison the reflective author of this drift in approach to China .\nBut he presents very little evidence for that .\nWhat his scrupulously evidenced record of the period indicates is initiatives by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade , diplomats , senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on , all pushing and pulling on the government , as the latter sought to keep channels open with China .\nIt is far more a picture of a government moving by responding to internal pressures and forces , something far more characteristic of Morrison than any big picture .\nCrucial to the notion of a long-term strategy is what seems to be Kelly \u2019 s attribution of AUKUS , and perhaps of the whole Indo-Pacific strategy , to Morrison .\nIs there any real evidence for this ?\nEvery sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a strategy after Trump \u2019 s lack of direction , and the sudden departure from Afghanistan was obviously a clearing of the decks for the new strategy .\nIt seemed clear that the US lined up the whole thing , with Europe ( that is , France ) as much a target as China , and assigned Australia a role , which we were glad to take up .\nKelly \u2019 s treatment of AUKUS is underdone to the point of distortion .\nHis focus on the submarine point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , which would necessarily bind our forces into a single US-led command , the basis of Paul Keating \u2019 s and ANU academic Hugh White \u2019 s criticisms of the deal \u2014 which Kelly then constructs as \u201c emotional \u201d .\nBewildered by the time lag of the submarine deal , Kelly has not read around enough to twig to the point made by UNSW academic Clinton Fernandes and others : that nuclear-prepared Australian ports can then be used by US subs , and that is the purpose of nuclear \u201c sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the never-never .\nTo many watching daily politics it will seem that the true Morrison is the man behind the cheap shots about Manchurian candidates : the parochial , Sydney-swaddled Christian cultist who is spending much of his time focused on waging war in the NSW branch of his own party right up to the election , rather than on any fancy-schmancy mission that would be of any help in a world suddenly engulfed in war .\nThis is Kelly at his most indulged and least self-aware .\nFor the past decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Australian politics and politicians to find something more than is there .\nThe process that he mapped in The March of Patriots , to the end of 2007 , delivered a country that did not live up such epic hopes : a thoroughly atomised society , in which public passions \u2014 whether of left cultural nationalism or right patriotism \u2014 have been transmuted into privatised lives and a few motifs in sport , Woolies Anzac Day ads and crackpot shambles like One Nation .\nSuch a culture gets the politicians that reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One telling moment in this book is Kelly \u2019 s attempt to link Morrison \u2019 s present to his Australian ancestral past and his admiration for Captain Cook .\nBut as anyone who has heard ScoMo bang on will attest , it \u2019 s not Cook he really admires but James T Kirk of the Starship Enterprise ( whom Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry modelled on Cook ) .\nWhy ?\nWell , Star Trek was compelling to most Gen-X kids \u2014 but especially to one being raised in a suburban cult church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s reverence of Cook has been added later , I have little doubt .\nKelly \u2019 s selection of it shows that he yearns for a division of the trivial and serious , the tactical and the considered , which has now mostly dissolved .\nThe strangeness of it all is that the book is a useful-enough account of our foreign policy shifts of the past few years , once Kelly \u2019 s blindspots are allowed for .\n\u201c For Biden , climate change is an act of faith , \u201d Kelly writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re better than that .\nDenialism is the act of faith .\nKelly , like many in the mainstream commentariat , has little scope to assess the actions of our leaders in terms of their lack of reason .\nGiven the selection we \u2019 ve had recently , that seems like a lack of imagination .\nMaybe that bit about the embassy in Jerusalem was ham-fisted electioneering .\nAnd maybe it was because it \u2019 s in the Book of Revelation .", "author":

to stop talking loudly and start using as big a stick as he can manage given Australia \u2019 s limited size and proximity .\nYesterday afternoon , in response to Putin \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine , he began catching up with where the Europeans were on Tuesday , extending sanctions on individuals to another 25 \u201c army commanders , deputy defence ministers and Russian mercenaries \u201d ,

to another four companies \u201c involved in the development and sale of military technology and weapons \u201d .\nThe Biden administration again went further .\nRussia \u2019 s biggest bank , Sberbank , was cut off from US-dollar transactions .\nIts second-largest bank , VTB , was also sanctioned and the administration froze the assets of another three banks .\nThirteen state-owned enterprises were sanctioned \u2014 along with Belarusian banks , firms and officials \u2014 seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology transfers were prohibited .\nAustralia obviously lacks the financial power of the United States , but the sheer extent of the new round of US sanctions makes Australia look dilatory and tokenistic at best .\nCredit where due , Morrison yesterday afternoon made sure he reached out to both Ukrainian Australians and to Australians of Russian background , discussing the government \u2019 s consultations with the Ukrainian community and adding , \u201c I want to send a particular message to Australians of Russian descent .\nI know that they will also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are of Ukrainian descent or Russian descent , we \u2019 re all Australians and we thank them for their contribution to Australia , and we stand together with them as Australians.\n\u201d It was an important signal of inclusiveness at a time of potential community division , and it stands in contrast to Tony Abbott \u2019 s deliberate targeting of Muslim Australians in 2015 .\nBut Morrison has a number of options if he wants to properly live up to his rhetoric of condemnation .\nExpel Russian diplomats in Australia : Morrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c even in moments of terrible conflicts such as this , it is important to maintain channels of communication \u201d .\nYet it is plain Putin is far beyond the point of communication , and in any event Morrison can always pick up a phone , rather than the Foreign Minister calling in the Russian ambassador for a \u201c dressing down \u201d .\nPutin \u2019 s man in Canberra must surely quake at the thought of a telling-off from Marise Payne .\nSeize Rusal \u2019 s 20 % stake in the Queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s giant aluminium producer , which earns billions in profits and holds a one-fifth stake in Rio Tinto \u2019 s QAL plant in Gladstone , Queensland .\nRusal \u2019 s board and management can direct their complaints to the Kremlin .\nEnd exports of alumina to Russia : Russia relies heavily on alumina exports from Ukraine and Australia \u2014 in our case , around half a billion dollars worth a year .\nTime to shut off its supply , which will in turn inflict significant damage on Russian exports of aluminium products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian imports : They \u2019 re worth $ 250 million a year to Russia , and they \u2019 re dominated by fertiliser and crude oil , which can be sourced elsewhere .\nBlock access for Russian students : It \u2019 s not a big market \u2014 around 1000 a year before the pandemic

recent to join their ranks is former columnist Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d be running for the Senate with the Reason Party .\nBut why are so many women stepping up to the plate now \u2014 and do they really represent a threat to Australia \u2019 s two-party system ?\nThere \u2019 s an undercurrent of anger for many independent candidates .\nWatching from the sidelines as the government bungled its bushfire response , COP22 , March4Justice and assault allegations , they felt the Coalition was failing over and over again .\nCaro flirted briefly with the idea of entering the 2018 race as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as not to split the vote .\nThis time , she \u2019 s going hell for leather .\n\u201c Watching this government , I \u2019 ve just become furious but also spirited and disgusted , \u201d Caro tells Crikey .\n\u201c I think that a lot of people , progressive people , people who care about our planet , and women , in particular , are feeling under threat.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s not just the current government at fault : many independents believe Australia \u2019 s democratic system is failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of touch with voters , using wedge politics to stop any kind of progression and preselecting their popular favourites instead of who is best for the role .\nFormer newspaper columnist Elizabeth Farrelly , who is running as an independent candidate for Strathfield , NSW , tells Crikey she \u2019 s seen these failures firsthand .\nIn 2018 she was approached by the Labor party to join with hints at running for the federal seat of Reid \u2014 before quickly realising that no matter how well she resonated with voters , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide her fate .\n\u201c There were no preselection battles \u2026 and once I left , party members were vindictive .\nThere was nastiness everywhere , which surprised me , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It was arrogant \u2026 and my treatment afterwards was unjustified and unwarranted , and , for me , reinforced my initial sense that both of the major parties are especially out of touch with the electorate.\n\u201d The Me Too movement exposed a dark and prevalent culture of sexual abuse and harassment in Australia , bolstered by prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kate , who accused Christian Porter of rape \u2014 which he strenuously denies \u2014 publicly telling their story .\nFarrelly believes the current feminist movement in Australia is 20-30 years overdue , with progression stalled following former minister for women Tony Abbott \u2019 s reign .\n\u201c We should be ashamed of how backwards it all is , \u201d she said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of hatred to women and we need to address it because it disempowers men as well as women.\n\u201d Speaking on a Crikey Talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgoing director of Adelaide Writers \u2019 Week and independent candidate for Boothby in South Australia , said the movement had played an important role in galvanising and amplifying independents .\nShe was a childhood friend of Kate , whose 51st birthday it would have been yesterday .\n\u201c Women are sick of waiting for power to be shared and they understand that now they need to get in there and take it , \u201d she said .\nDyer believes the movement showed older women that daily harassment wasn \u2019 t something they just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a generation of women saying , \u2018 We are not going to accept the shame \u2026 and we will find a voice to lay the shame where it belongs , which is back with the perpetrator.\n\u2019 \u201d She said this became particularly apparent after Scott Morrison announced his support for Porter despite Kate \u2019 s allegation .\n\u201c We hear the rhetoric all the time from people , including the prime minister , who was saying , \u2018 We need to hear your stories , we need to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dyer said .\n\u201c But when there \u2019 s a very specific story , which doesn \u2019 t suit our political agenda , then we are going to dismiss it.\n\u201d What outcome do they want ?\nFarrelly , Caro and Dyer are each progressives who have previously supported the Labor party .\nBut they each want a different outcome in the upcoming election : Dyer believes a Labor majority with an independent crossbench would be the best outcome ; Caro simply wants the current government to go \u2014 and would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrelly believes a hung Parliament would be a fantastic outcome .\n\u201c These independent women are actually independent , \u201d she said .\n\u201c They \u2019 re going to work according to principle and not along party lines , which means each vote has a conscience vote.\n\u201d But whether the scores of independents rushing to the political field will actually be a threat to the government remains to be seen .\nAlready it appears some Liberals are squirming : Tim Wilson has asked constituents to dob in people erecting Zoe Daniel political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has attempted to frame the independents as a front for Labor .\nWhile Caro believes independents have been underestimated , she said the level of support she was receiving online showed many candidates were getting the attention they deserved .\n\u201c The tone has been , \u2018 Oh , at last , someone I \u2019 d actually want to vote for \u2019 , \u201d she said .", "author": "Amber Schultz", "url":

about a \u201c new world order \u201d against Russia has gone viral after being picked up by conspiracy theorists .\nRudyk made the comment during an interview on Fox News on Monday when talking about defending democracy against Russia .\nThe phrase \u201c new world order \u201d is a term regularly used to describe a time of change .\nIt \u2019 s also the name of a longstanding conspiracy theory about a global totalitarian government run by shadowy forces like the illuminati or Freemasons .\nThe theory often carries anti-Semitic undertones .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ some expected it would garner some attention .\nAnd it did .\nThere were hundreds of posts \u2014 many explicitly endorsing conspiracy theories \u2014 about the MP \u2019 s comments on Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine .\nA similar

trended on Twitter in Australia \u2014 and then around the world .\nOne version of the video posted by a user on Twitter has gained more than 2.5 million views .\nGoogle searches for \u201c new world order \u201d spiked .\nSome of the attention came from anti-government conspiracy theorists who said the phrase proved that Australia \u2019 s strict COVID-19 public health measures were actually more sinister .\nEveryone from anti-vaxxers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s biggest right-wing YouTubers , Steven Crowder , shared it on Facebook , Twitter and Telegram .\nMany sharers seemed to be sceptical of the conspiracy but were sharing it because they expected it would pique the interest of fringe social media users .\nLikewise with Rudyk \u2019 s comment \u2014 it was represented as not an innocuous turn of phrase but rather a slip of the tongue that revealed that the invasion was actually an attempt to install a new world order .\nOf course , the use of the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state \u2019 s chief health officer or the Ukrainian MP that she was installing herself as a global monarch .\n( If that was the goal , it would be ill-advised to announce it at a press conference or in an interview

life of their own .\nUntil recently a comment like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a write-up in the traditional media before being quickly forgotten .\nNow it is likely to live on as part of the corpus of out-of-context moments and events that conspiracists use to reinforce and promote their world views .\nMore than anything else , these \u201c new world order \u201d comments are perfect grist for the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) released another report warning that the country is woefully under-prepared for a global heating crisis that will impact us more severely than any other advanced economy .\nThese two things are overtly linked : the report made clear that flash flooding , the likes of which have left Lismore under 14 metres of water this week , is set to increase .\nMeanwhile , on the current warming trajectory , Australia \u2019 s GDP growth would be hammered , hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year and ecosystems like coral reefs would wither away .\nBut in a week where Australia lived through the kind of future bodies like the IPCC have been warning us about for decades , the political response to the report was strangely muted .\nEverybody wanted to talk about the floods .\nClimate remained the elephant in the room , as it so often is during the natural disasters that seem to hit Australia with even greater frequency .\nThe lacklustre response to the report was most obvious from the government .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its Sixth Assessment Report in August last year , Prime Minister Scott Morrison held a press conference alongside Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor to address the \u201c very serious matter \u201d of the IPCC \u2019 s latest findings .\nThis week \u2019 s report was the sequel \u2014 focusing on adaptation , impacts and vulnerability , or an illustration of how the current flood crisis will become a new normal .\nMorrison currently has COVID , and his public statements have so far focused on the flood response and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presser on Tuesday , hours after the IPCC report was released , it didn \u2019 t get a mention .\nThe only acknowledgement from Morrison was a brief line from a spokesman for the PM telling AAP that Australia had reduced emissions faster than many comparable countries .\nTaylor has put out six media releases since the report dropped on Monday night without mentioning it .\nEnvironment Minister Sussan Ley is yet to comment publicly on the report .\nEmergency Services Minister Bridget McKenzie was asked about the report on ABC News Breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right \u201d , before attacking big emitters for their failure to plan for net zero .\nWhich is funny because McKenzie , along with her colleagues in the Nationals party room , spent months holding the government to ransom over a net zero commitment .\nAlthough Labor \u2019 s response to the floods has been to point out where the government was inadequately prepared , the opposition did at least acknowledge the report \u2019 s existence .\nOpposition climate and energy spokesperson Chris Bowen actually drew the link between the report and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another stark warning .\nBut it \u2019 s a stark warning which is particularly relevant to Australian , \u201d he said on Tuesday .\n\u201c This report itself highlights some of the impacts on Australians and on Australia , which are at the same time , completely unsurprising and totally shocking in terms of the impact on Australians and the Australian way of life.\n\u201d Still , Labor notably didn \u2019 t use the report as an opportunity to kick the government particularly hard on climate \u2014 save a few tweets from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate and energy program director Richie Merzian said the political response to the report was muted , despite the current crisis clearly reflecting the authors \u2019 warnings .\n\u201c The report is timed with , ironically , a massive , extreme weather event that is linked to climate change .\nIt \u2019 s crystal clear we \u2019 re going to get more floods , \u201d he said .\nIn pure political terms , the response from both parties makes sense .\nWhen the last report was released , Morrison was still trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction \u201c plan \u201d both to the electorate and recalcitrant Nationals .\nNow , any mention of climate reminds voters of another source of deep division within the Coalition ranks , and a net zero package even big business thought was inadequate .\nFor Labor , going too hard on climate risks being hit with the kind of scare campaign that saw them blown away in Queensland at the last election .\nThe opposition hopes its \u201c goldilocks \u201d plan to lower emissions 43 % by 2030 is enough to appear both ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the dreaded climate wedge .\nAll this means is that the major parties are reluctant to join the dots between the current crisis and the bigger climate emergency .\nFor Merzian , politicians \u2019 reluctance to go near climate during an emergency is a sign of how polarised and antagonistic the debate has become .\n\u201c Climate change has been so politicised in Australia that there isn \u2019 t even the breathing space to have the discussion , \u201d he said .", "author": "Kishor Napier-Raman", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/03/03/coalition-ignores-ipcc-climate-report/",

the case for an increasingly volatile climate \u2014 to argue that they are exploited to promote the idea of climate change : \u201c Here come the vultures again.\n\u201d While people are looking at

the greenest of scientists maintain that you simply can not link climate change to single disasters , \u201d he said .\nSmith instead blames the influence of La Ni\u00f1a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more extreme , according to research by the US \u2019 s scientific body , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\nSky News host Paul Murray riffed on the same accusation of politicising the climate , going as far to say that Scott Morrison is being \u201c dehumanised \u201d by the criticism .\nAnother strategy has been to cite historical records of previous floods to argue that they are regular and therefore not a consequence of a changing climate .\nAdvance Australia , a right-wing advocacy group that pulled $ 1.3 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delved into Bureau of Meteorology records to claim these floods were actually very normal : \u201c Since the 1890s there have been nine weather stations that have recorded more than a metre of rain over a four-day period ( see below ) .\n\u201d According to Facebook , this was shared hundreds of times and had thousands of engagements , making it one of most viral pieces of content about Australia \u2019 s floods last week .\nUnfortunately

century , and none were from the past three decades .\nWhile there are many factors influencing floods , climate change affects the weather on top of existing variability .\nOne Nation MPs Malcolm Roberts and Mark Latham both played on this same misinterpretation , citing old records or sharing old photos of floods .\nRather than addressing climate change \u2014 something that both men deny \u2014 Roberts argues instead for dams .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ change ?\nSilence .\nNews Corp \u2019 s Facebook pages for The Australian , The Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun haven \u2019 t mentioned

Try this", "content": "I know , lawyers are required to be serious .\nMea culpa .\nThe question had arisen in the course of Scott Morrison \u2019 s Dear Leader-style visit to flood-ravaged Lismore on Wednesday as to why he had left it until well after half of NSW had gone under and resurfaced before deciding to declare it a national emergency .\nI thought the sarcasm was unsubtle enough to be visible from space but , judging by the responses , no .\nWe had created considerable consternation and a very modern problem : fake law .\nSo we did the responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have done the trick .\nStill , the serious question remains : why the late declaration ?\nThe correct answer is the obvious one : there was no reason to not declare a national emergency earlier , unless the prime minister was insisting on announcing it himself , standing on a pile of waterlogged furniture like George W Bush at Ground Zero .\nAnd Morrison , as it happened , was in COVID isolation until the day the emergency was declared .\nCoincidence ?\nWith this government , there is no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely boring .\nAfter the 2019 bushfire/Hawaii disaster , the government rushed through a law , the National Emergency Declaration Act , the idea being to streamline such declarations and the attendant opening of the federal emergency relief tap ( at least in theory ) .\nTechnically , national emergency declarations are made by the governor-general as part of the ongoing make-work scheme upholding his or her position as ostensible head of the executive government .\nIt \u2019 s a bit pointless for laws like this one , which gives the G-G no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prime minister who has to be satisfied it \u2019 s needed .\nThe grounds are \u201c nationally significant harm \u201d , real or likely .\nThe trigger can be a request from a state or territory government , but ( contrary to what a lot of federal government ministers have been saying this week ) that isn \u2019 t necessary .\nThe feds can also do it if they \u2019 re satisfied it is \u201c appropriate , having regard to the nature of the emergency and the nature and severity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discretionary power designed to be wider than the Nullarbor .\nThe only real check on it is the existence of harm , so the courts could invalidate a declaration if the government had simply made that up .\nWould anyone ever challenge a national emergency declaration ?\nIt doesn \u2019 t authorise turning out the troops \u2014 they can do that on request by a state government under other laws ( which are more problematic than this one ) .\nWell , they might have cause to want to .\nThe act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declaration , but it contains a dangerous sleeper .\nWhile a declaration is in force , the act gives all federal ministers extra special powers enabling them , by legislative instrument ( meaning personal fiat ) , to vary the effect of Commonwealth laws in certain respects .\nThis can be useful .\nFor example , a minister can relieve people of strict requirements to sign or witness documents or provide information to government agencies , things which can solve otherwise difficult logistical problems in an emergency .\nBut it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit the minister responsible for the freedom of information law to neuter its effectiveness , or the minister responsible for welfare payments to actually make life harder for recipients by imposing more onerous burdens rather than less .\nWith any luck such things remain hypotheticals for nitpicky lawyers and nothing more .\nLike many of the laws on our federal statute books , luck is all we have to go on .\nA law which says that acts of Parliament can be varied by anyone other than Parliament is dangerous ( and @ @ @

, along with the gig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and finance .\nIn addition to the No.. 2 slot at the RBA , Debelle is well known and respected at the top levels of global finance and markets .\nHe oversaw reforms to a new-look global rate setting mechanism which reformed the much abused Libor ( or London Interbank Offer Rate ) and a new code of conduct for global foreign exchange markets after massive

with the new", "content": "Labor has engaged in a disciplined strategy to rebuild the public presentation of Anthony Albanese \u2014 and last night it starred in its own TV show .\nThe opposition leader was the subject of a light-touch profile on 60 Minutes on the Nine network , after a similar program on Scott Morrison four weeks ago .\nLabor has been sprucing up Albanese \u2014 and the reinvention seems to be working .\nJust minutes before the segment was aired The Australian online reported Newspoll \u2019 s finding that he and Morrison were level as preferred prime minister and Labor retained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success comes with questions for Labor .\nOne of the best things going for Albanese this election is that he \u2019 s not Scott Morrison .\nBut his transformation invites doubts as to whether he \u2019 s Anthony Albanese , either .\nIf the old Albanese wasn \u2019 t good enough for the job of prime minister , why would the new version be suddenly suitable ?\nThe election will put a possibly unprecedented focus on the character , competence and deportment of the leaders of the major parties .\nThis in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed policy competition \u2014 it threatens to be a policy-free electron .\nLabor does have priorities rather than boofy , detailed policies .\nSuch as pledges to reduce an average household \u2019 s power bill by $ 275 a year by 2025 and boosting free TAFE courses by 465,000 and university places by 20,000 .\nBut as significant as they are , these are unlikely to be the principal areas of electoral competition .\nPropelling Albanese towards what he hopes will be victory is Morrison \u2019 s baggage of widely nominated shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has all that going for him ?\nAlbanese \u2014 bookie and pollster favourite to win the election expected in May \u2014 will be unrecognisable to some long-time fans , and an unknown quantity to others abruptly introduced to him , particularly voters in the middle ground to whom he will seem to have come from nowhere .\nMany of the changes have been cosmetic \u2014 like the male model poses of his Women \u2019 s Weekly photo shoot \u2014 but there has been more involved than merely shedding 18 kilograms or buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a new hairdo that does the same .\nSuperficial or not , the overhaul has been the product of some deep thinking .\nThe promotion of Albanese \u2019 s credentials has been a theme of the redo , in part as a counter to Morrison \u2019 s attack that his \u201c inexperienced \u201d rival \u2014 who actually was a deputy prime minister in his ministerial career \u2014 has never had to manage the national accounts .\nAlbanese in reply has argued he is the direct legatee of Bob Hawke and Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the idolised Labor prime ministers Ben Chifley and John Curtin when it comes to manufacturing .\nPromoting his economic CV has at times pushed the boundaries of belief , as shown in this passage from a February profile in The Australian Financial Review : \u201c His first job out of school was with the Commonwealth Bank .\nHis high school commerce teacher insisted Albanese and his classmates purchase The Australian Financial Review every day , with their own money , \u201d it reads in a remarkable cross-promotion of the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that from his teenage years Albanese has checked the All Ords before breakfast , a practice many close colleagues are not aware of .\nIt is strange that a former minister who had important responsibilities such as transport , the digital economy , regional development and communications would have to reintroduce himself to the electorate .\nThis process has gone beyond the usual burnishing of the official record and finding a decent tailor .\nOne reason for part of the overhaul might be that Albanese did not look or sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the carriage of a leader who could speak for Australia on the White House lawns while standing next to the president .\nToday he doesn \u2019 t look or sound exactly like the Albanese who was elevated , unopposed , as Labor leader \u2014 and thus alternative prime minister \u2014 in May 2019 .\nThree years ago some observers might have contended Albanese would never become PM .\nIn part they could be right , as the Albanese of May 2022 won \u2019 t appear to be the one of May

sort of lateral thinking .\nA bold gesture to address one of Australia \u2019 s major economic challenges is staring us right in the face , but we \u2019 re so silo-bound in our thinking we can \u2019 t grasp it .\nCurrently over a million Ukrainians have fled Russia \u2019 s sickening invasion .\nOther countries \u2014 with the notable exception of post-Brexit Britain \u2014 are opening their doors to Ukrainians .\nHere , the Morrison government has only said priority will be given to fleeing Ukrainians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far .\nMeanwhile business constantly urges an increase in both temporary and permanent migration to address workforce shortages , with unemployment at 4.2 % , major workforce sectors like aged care shrinking when we need them to be rapidly expanding , and even the government flagging it needs to find 20,000 extra defence personnel in the next decade and a half .\nBut as Crikey \u2019 s Amber Schultz reported last week , the small number of Ukrainians who have so far reached Australia are being given tourist visas .\nThere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Justin Trudeau , who has thrown Canada \u2019 s doors open to as many Ukrainians as it can take .\nA similar Australian gesture \u2014 say , a pledge to welcome 100,000 Ukrainians as permanent migrants in a special visa class for victims of the invasion \u2014 would be a worthwhile permanent expansion of our labour force , reducing the reliance of business on easily exploited temporary workers .\nIt would also go some small way to restoring Australia \u2019 s dismal reputation for hostility to refugees .\nWhile the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all conflicts \u2014 want to go home once peace is restored , the likelihood of Russian domination of Ukraine when the invasion is finally successful , or the installation of a puppet regime in Kyiv in thrall to Putin \u2019 s gangsters , will likely encourage Ukrainians to stay away \u2014 most likely in Europe , where so many have family or cultural ties , or where they have studied or visited .\nThe risk to Ukraine is the continued flight of its best and brightest , but that can be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installs in Kyiv .\nBut many might like to move to somewhere warmer , where employment is plentiful .\nLike every other developed country with an ageing population , Australia faces a long-term challenge of finding a labour force .\nRelying on temporary migration to fill the gaps is a self-defeating solution in an environment in which labour will grow increasingly scarce .\nIf about half of the hundred thousand migrants wanted to join the workforce , it would only add around 50,000 people a workforce of over 13 million \u2014 so unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as permanent migrants they would provide the economic benefits long touted by advocates for higher immigration in terms of increased demand .\nThey would become a new story in Australia \u2019 s migration history , another reason to boast of our success as a multicultural society .\nSo where is the business lobby , calling for Australia to take as many Ukrainians as it can ?\nWhere are the calls in the Australian Financial Review for the government to throw open our borders to address the nightmarish shortage of workers ?\nWhere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Shepherd and Innes Willox who \u2014 to their immense credit \u2014 travelled to the Middle East , saw first-hand what was happening , and called for Australia to take in Syrian refugees in 2015 ?\nIt \u2019 s time for Australia to open its doors .\nIt \u2019 s the humanitarian thing to do ,

used .\nThe group \u2014 whose founders have said Lismore \u2019 s flooding was planned by the government and which has been promoted by figures such as Pete Evans \u2014 raised the money while spreading misinformation about the Red Cross and other charities .\nAmong the dozens of online appeals calling for help for people affected by floods in Queensland and northern NSW , new group Aussie Helping Hands say they \u2019 ve raised hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although Crikey was unable to independently verify this number .\nIts website lists three people who have espoused anti-vaccine beliefs : David Oneeglio , Dotti Janssen and Hayley Birtles-Eades .\nThe three began collaborating on Aussie Helping Hands earlier this month .\nThe group \u2019 s website \u2014 registered under Birtles-Eades \u2019 name \u2014 and Facebook page were created a week ago .\nA domain for the organisation launched a week earlier listed the group as \u201c a unified initiative by awakened Aussies \u201d .\nThe term \u201c awakened \u201d is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distrust institutions and mainstream media in favour of fringe views .\nOneeglio is a major Australian conspiracy influencer who has emerged as one of the biggest voices in the anti-vaccine , anti-government \u201c freedom \u201d movements .\nIn his many daily vlogs posted to his 70,000 subscribers on Telegram , Oneeglio documents himself travelling to different protests and speaking about various conspiracy theories \u2014 including that the Lismore flood , much like the 9/11 terror attacks , was a controlled demolition .\nHe cites the use of a \u201c rain bomb \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia , a website promoting sovereign citizenry and links to the anti-vax documentary Plandemic and other conspiracy content .\nBirtles-Eades is the founder of a PR agency who has posted anti-vaccine content on her Telegram account and shared videos on an Instagram account of her interviewing conspiracy theorists such as Fanos Panayides .\nThe group has been boosted by significant figures in the conspiracy movement , such as disgraced chef Pete Evans , pro-Putin anti-lockdown activist Simeon Boikov ( also known as \u201c Aussie Cossack \u201d ) and former porn addict and Qantas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refusing to be vaccinated .\nPosts in online conspiracy and anti-vaccine groups appeal to anti-government sentiment and call for donations to Aussie Helping Hands instead .\nAussie Helping Hands promises to help flood victims by coordinating donations and volunteers .\nTheir pitch is to \u201c avoid management fees typically seen by major charities \u201d and ensure that \u201c financial transactions , both given and received , are documented for transparency \u201d .\nThe group is upfront about not being a charity and that donations to it are not tax-deductible .\nThe do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have \u201c secured \u201d a 300-square-metre commercial space to operate from , but according to one person Crikey spoke to they have been working out of Coraki Fire Station , about 25km from Lismore .\nDespite regularly updating their website as donations roll in , the group \u2019 s promised record of spending has failed to eventuate so far .\nSome people following the group have started to raise questions about how the money is being distributed .\n\u201c This \u2018 charity \u2019 has some concerning red flags and should be reported \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d wrote one person in the group \u2019 s Telegram channel .\nSome evidence of the group \u2019 s work has been posted to the group \u2019 s and some of the founders \u2019 social media accounts .\nVideos of boxes of supplies have been posted .\nTwo people say they have received some money and volunteering assistance from the group .\nMore than anything , the group has shared dozens of screenshots and requests for help while calling for more donations .\nCrikey sent a number of questions about the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email address .\nSomeone operating the account repeatedly promised to respond but never did .\nIt was only after Crikey asked about ways that people who wanted help from the group could make a request that the group added a \u201c register to be helped \u201d section on its website .\nThe group has fundraised off the back of allegations that charities such as the Red Cross are corrupt or incompetent .\nRooted in real criticism about the Red Cross being slow to act and high-profile legal issues around Celeste Barber \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inaccurate statistics about these charities accompanied by a call-to-action to donate have gone viral in online conspiracy groups .\nOne image which was widely shared across Facebook and Twitter falsely claims that $ 108.9 million of the $ 147 million raised for the 2019-20 bushfires went missing and that readers should instead give to Aussie Helping Hands .\nAs of March 2 , the Red Cross says that 96 % of the $ 242 million raised has been spent , with less than 5 % taken for administration costs .\nCity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold Coast Bulletin that he was flooded with anti-Red Cross conspiracy theories when he posted a link to its fundraiser earlier this week .\nPart of this animosity is founded in Red Cross \u2019 s support for vaccination .\nOneeglio shared a photograph of a television showing celebrity Scott Cam during the Red Cross televised flood appeal with the caption : \u201c this poison pusher sellout is now promoting Red Cross \u201d .\nA spokesperson for Red Cross told Crikey its expertise in helping during disasters allows it to cover both the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Cross programs are also underpinned by best practice from around the globe , for example our teams are doing similar work right now in the Ukraine crisis.\n\u201d The scale and difficulty of the work that Aussie Helping Hands will need to do to effectively allocate donations appears to be apparent to the group \u2019 s founders .\nIn a video , Oneeglio speaks about the group \u2019 s inexperience .\n\u201c That \u2019 s $ 200,000 .\nNone of us have handled this sort of money before .\nI \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a lot of money

) of using union cars and taxi vouchers for personal use , of Kitching running a ( failed ) campaign for preselection to the Labor seat of Gellibrand using union print resources , and of taking payout

highest paid union official at the time , spent around $ 100,000 on a freeway billboard campaign featuring her picture and little else about the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union \u2019 s building for $ 7

bought illegally with union funds , and which HSU3 ( now the Victorian Allied Health Professionals Association ) was now trying to sell to return the money to members .\nMeanwhile Kitching burnished her credentials with a complete fantasy tale \u2014 inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together shredded documents to help implicate Jackson \u2014 even though Jackson had run a different union , and the commission said the material was \u201c useless \u201d .\nDoes any of this add up to anything huge ?\nNot bit by bit .\nIt \u2019 s the pathetic , squalid daily business of factional campaigning

recent migrants .\nSo when I say that I don \u2019 t believe for a second Asmar \u2019 s account of Kitching \u2019 s \u201c terror \u201d at Wong et al , it \u2019 s because her ability to spin a whole story out of not much is well documented .\nIf I don \u2019 t believe Kitching \u2019 s claim she was being impacted by the factional conflict she was involved in , it \u2019 s because there is an established record of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official procedures , and good evidence of personal corruption .\nThis is all without considering Kitching \u2019 s knowledge of her husband \u2019 s financial chaos , and his sudden sojourn to Costa Rica \u2014 an event which she presented as a complete surprise to her , something no one has ever believed for a second .\nThis must , as they say in court , go to character .\nOr lack thereof .\nThis stuff matters .\nIt matters in the assessment of what Kitching had said , what Asmar has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for what reason .\nWhether people understand the factional politics or not , they understand sharp operators who pretend to be victims and leave a paper trail to turn standard conflict into victimisation , because there \u2019 s one of these people in every workplace ( yes , as well as the genuinely bullied ) .\nI mean , our non-corrupted commentators should be able to explain that Kitching \u2019 s presentation of a seven-page letter to Richard Marles about \u201c bullying \u201d was never expected to yield action , because Marles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her seat back ( they regard it as their own ) .\nIt was there to jam him up later .\nHe knew , she knew , he knew , etc and so on .\nAfter all , the whole corrupt branch-stacking adventure of Shorten/the AWU \u2019 s ally Adem Somyurek was designed to destroy Marles \u2019 s power base .\nAnd when that was exposed and the Feds took over the Victorian branch \u2014 to cut this group out for once and for all \u2014 what was the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ?\nAsmar ( HWU ) and others v Albanese .\nHow did they run the argument ?\nBy saying that intervention was a sexist attack on proud Labor women .\nSound familiar ?\nThe mainstream media \u2019 s readers need this information on these arcane worlds to make a decision about the claims they \u2019 re hearing .\nWhat do they get from Andrew Probyn , Samantha Maiden , Katharine Murphy and Laura Tingle ?\nNothing except generalities about factional warfare , \u201c not without sin \u201d , and then back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , covers their lack of knowledge about where the factions are at , and allows them to suck up to a public who sees the world increasingly in personal terms , and who might find the sudden discussion of actual politics a bit cold and reflecting poorly \u2014 in empath terms \u2014 on actual political correspondents .\nThus , Tingle alone pointed out that Kitching lost her place on the party \u2019 s tactics committee because she leaked to Linda Reynolds that Labor had the info on the Brittany Higgins rape accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c depoliticise \u201d it \u2014 but she was happy to de facto trade it for political capital with another one of her cross-party , pro-US colleagues .\nHaving noted that , Tingle then relapses into the bullying narrative , without helping her readership to understand the political infighting it represented , and the point of it .\nSo it relapses into \u201c mean girl \u201d stuff .\nIt \u2019 s hopeless .\nI am not asking these people to push a certain interpretation .\nNo , I \u2019 m saying that omission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience is not \u201c giving people the facts \u201d as they claim \u2014 it \u2019 s not giving the full picture , the one it \u2019 s your damn job to give .\nYour correspondent was hoping someone would write all this up last week* .\nIt \u2019 s no joy to tell these truths on the day of someone \u2019 s funeral .\nBut since the funeral itself has been turned into a public occasion as part of this campaign , it seems necessary .\nFor the past two years , Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factional clique ( hence the espionage-quality bugging of their ally Somyurek , his exposure and the destruction of his faction ) .\nThey didn \u2019 t get there fast enough .\nIt \u2019 s not Labor that has a sickness at its heart ; it \u2019 s this marginal and desperate crowd that do .\nIf this gang really help Morrison slide back in , it will be the crowning anti-achievement of their decades of operation , their masterpiece of nihilism and resentment betraying the hard work and hopes of tens and hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a fair election we may get a government of simple competence and decency \u2014 and not another Rupert Murdoch black mass .\nIf this group keep this stuff up , rank-and-file members who actually want to win an election should occupy their offices , and put a stop to their treachery and sabotage .\nAnything \u2019 s better than the possibility they may throw it away for you , surely ?\nOr true believers can look forward to the increased possibility of a late Saturday night in May , standing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech\u2026 \u201d And I am not the only one in the media politics hinterland to conclude from these events that our complicit mainstream media is now beyond any sort of joke , a broke-down , right-wing propaganda mill of some dirtwater junta dogpatch somewhere , run by vipers , their shivering sycophants and enabling airheads without a care for what their country has become , or where it \u2019 s going next .\nRequiescat in pace .\nRes ipsa

world order \u201d amid the Russia-Ukraine war .\nThe phrase \u201c new world order \u201d is a term regularly used to describe a time of change .\nIt \u2019 s also the name of a longstanding conspiracy theory about a global totalitarian government run by shadowy forces like the illuminati or Freemasons .\nThe theory often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was uttered , some expected it would garner some

in Australia \u2014 and then around the world .\nOne version of the video posted by a user on Twitter has gained more than 2.5 million views .\nGoogle searches for \u201c new world order \u201d spiked .\nSome of the attention came from anti-government conspiracy theorists who said the phrase proved that Australia \u2019 s strict COVID-19 public health measures were actually more sinister .\nEveryone from anti-vaxxers to QAnon believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest right-wing YouTubers , Steven Crowder , shared it on Facebook , Twitter and Telegram .\nMany sharers seemed to be sceptical of the conspiracy but were sharing it because they expected it would pique the interest of fringe social media users .\nLikewise with Biden \u2019 s comment \u2014 it was represented as not an innocuous turn of phrase but rather a slip of the tongue that revealed his attempts to create a new world order .\nOf course , the use of the phrase wasn \u2019 t an announcement by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US

clearly not all humans were , in her view , entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary performer and consistent advocate , she was no better and certainly no worse than most of the people who shuffle through the Senate via the major parties .\nAnd none of that changes that she died far too young and with so much undone .\nWhere Kitching stands out , however , is an example of how hollowed-out our major parties are .\nFor much of the past 50 years , the narrative around political party membership has been one of constant decline from the mid-century period of genuine mass membership .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inexorable decline of membership has morphed into the rise of factional players and powerbrokers .\nSuch figures have always existed , of course \u2014 but being a factional heavyweight in a party with large memberships and powerful unions is very different from being one in a party of double-digit branch memberships and unions that can \u2019 t muster 10 % of the workforce .\nAs parties have shrunk , they \u2019 ve become ever more the plaything of small-time figures who can , by dint of drawing heavily from targeted community groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by branch .\nKitching \u2019 s home state of Victoria , which has thrown up \u2014 in both senses \u2014 figures like Marcus Bastiaan and Adem Somyurek , is the best example of this process of hollowing-out of political parties that once , in an earlier century , could claim to be mass movements .\nAnd this process has been enabled by the way we \u2019 ve allowed political parties to detach themselves from the community and exist independently of electorates .\nWe \u2019 ve allowed parties to draw heavily on public funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large memberships isn \u2019 t a problem .\nWe \u2019 ve allowed the professionalisation of politics so that both sides are dominated by former staffers and party and union executives .\nKitching \u2014 who devoted her career to playing intra-party games , undermining factional opponents and pursuing the interests of her own political clique \u2014 was the perfect example .\nAnd the media is complicit in the whole process of detaching politics from democracy .\nAt the micro level , political journalists are more than happy to provide platforms for politicians to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one press gallery stenographer lamented last week that he \u2019 d no longer be receiving prolific WhatsApp messages from Kitching ) .\nIt makes for great copy , and saves the trouble of actually getting across genuine issues of public policy .\nIn the world of hollowed-out parties , the media is for leaking to , not holding the powerful to account ;

intelligence ) .\n\u201d Pause .\n\u201c She had certainly been warned about me \u201d .\nGot a good laugh .\nHe spoke of her belief in America , and the last best hope , and Bobby Kennedy , and I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that .\nHe spoke of her as the better part of him , of restraining his worst qualities , mitigating his disasters .\nHe left so many of those disasters out of the telling that he sounded like a Marxist giving a history of the USSR .\nHe reflected that she might have been better off without him .\nHe quoted Henley \u2019 s Invictus : \u201c I have not winced or cried aloud / Under the bludgeonings of chance \u201d \u2014 his voice caught for a second , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head is bloody but unbowed \u201d .\nMany would agree that Kitching may have gone further without him , but she clearly wasn \u2019 t one of them .\nWhether that was because they were star-crossed lovers or natural born killers is a question for history .\nNone of the essentially sociopathic things this man has lent his energy to , the destruction and suffering he has caused , were undone by this speech \u2014 but nor do they tarnish the dignity and grace of it , this commendation to the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure is nearer to the dark .\nBut the sun was still bright in the late afternoon they bore the bier out to , grey hearse in the forecourt , first hint of red in

accused of being her tormenters , ( for normal party activity and abrasiveness ) , looked sharp and elite , like their bosses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , people care about jobs , and security , and China , etc .\nBut they don \u2019 t really know about it , en masse .\nThey do know about bullying , or harassment , or victimhood , or trauma , and so on , because everyday life now consists of the

grouping put together by Lindsay Tanner in the 1990s after he and others took the Federated Clerks Union away from the right \u2014 and on the march to technocracy from the very start ( via

want to re-gender Melbourne tourist attraction the clipper ship Polly Woodside as \u201c they/them \u201d .\nThis is not an entirely fair summary , but ehhh .\nSo , yes , the process isn \u2019 t just a stoush with the Shorten group , but they \u2019 re the only ones taking it outside the party , and creating empath narratives that the Coalition can use to pull themselves out of the pit .\nNevertheless , the party centre \u2019 s push is undoubtably a total power grab .\nIn recent times some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitching developed , since they want to make cars , and she tanks against the coming Chinese invasion .\nThe forces these two statist tendencies are up against \u2014 the \u201c National \u201d Left and the Conroyite Right \u2014 are essentially minimalist technocrats , left and right of a social market/neoliberal divide .\nThe Nat Left want to roll out programs that supplement the dominance of the market rather than move beyond it ; the Conroyite Right don \u2019 t seem to care what gender your nine-year-old thinks it is .\nDifferences on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alternative viewpoints is , in their eyes , streamlining the party .\nIt \u2019 s a self-fulfilling prophecy .\nI \u2019 m on Carr \u2019 s side on this , and the pincer movement against them fills me with melancholy .\nBut O paradox , it must be said that with the death of Kitching , that goal got , in the most awful possible way , somewhat closer .\nThat was what was happening here , the end of something more than the life of Kimberley Kitching .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known them , the last Tsars ,

prominent anti-vaccine voices in the so-called \u201c freedom \u201d movement , such as United Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist Real Rukshan , and protest organiser Harrison McLean , each of whom have seen significant slides in engagement .\nThe peak for Australia \u2019 s anti-vaccine movement was between September and the end of last year .\nEvents such as the Melbourne protests that kicked off outside the CFMMEU offices , the \u201c Kill the Bill \u201d protests against Victoria \u2019 s new pandemic bill , and the beginning of Parliament House protests each acted as lightning rods .\nThey provided a concrete call to action , a sense of growing momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of 2022 , things were changing .\nThe vast majority of Australians had been vaccinated and COVID-19

lives .\nThey were already over the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canberra .\nOne researcher told Crikey that she believed that part of the appeal for many of the freedom figures to make the pilgrimage to Canberra at the beginning of February was that protests had begun to die down in cities like Sydney and Melbourne .\nIt was a last-gasp effort .\nSubsequent protests in places like Sydney , Melbourne and Brisbane are happening less frequently and attended by fewer people .\nSome of the major livestreamers like Real Rukshan have stopped attending protests .\nThe protests were a virtuous cycle : swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences from around the world to tune in , which in turn fed the protests .\nThe backslide in interest has reversed the dynamic .\nSmaller , monotonous protests on an increasingly irrelevant issue aren \u2019 t drawing the same audiences , which means there \u2019 s even less reason to livestream or watch for all but the diehards .\nOut of sight , out of mind .\nThe anti-vaccine movement tried its hand at electoral politics but has been unsuccessful so far .\nDespite a widely held mistrust in institutions , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the state elections since the pandemic , no single-issue , anti-vaccine , anti-mandate candidate has been even close to being elected , nor has there been a surge in support for established parties who flirt with the movement

support .\nThe introduction of electoral politics into the movement has produced problems of its own .\nThe United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-vaccine rhetoric at first was welcomed by the movement , including the formation of a partnership with Reignite Democracy Australia , but the relationship soon frayed .\nTelegram channels were filled with discussions about how Clive Palmer \u2019 s red shoes and Craig Kelly \u2019 s hand gestures were signs that they were puppets of the new world order .\nMonica Smit \u2019 s fianc\u00e9 , an anti-vaccine content creator called Morgan C Jonas , publicly resigned as a candidate for the United Australia Party and chose to instead run as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running for different parties as well as between those who wanted \u201c political politicians \u201d \u2014 as one Convoy to Canberra organiser said \u2014 to stay out of the movement .\nThe millions of dollars raised through the pandemic for legal challenges against vaccine mandates and COVID-19 restrictions have largely come to nothing .\nNathan Buckley , who had created several online fundraisers for class action suits that had all been unsuccessful , has had his practising licence suspended and is running for One Nation .\nAustralia \u2019 s longest running anti-vaxxer group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently raised nearly half a million dollars for a legal challenge against the Therapeutic Goods Administration \u2019 s approval of COVID-19 vaccines , which has yet to even prove it has legal standing to go ahead .\nPerhaps sensing the shifting energy , major figures in the movement have also begun to focus on other issues .\nPro-Russian messages about the war in Ukraine and the floods in Queensland and northern NSW , the spiritual home of Australia \u2019 s anti-vaccine movements , have taken over feeds once dedicated to vaccine misinformation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focusing on the federal election by spreading lies about electoral fraud .\nThe consequences for those most involved in the movement continue to pile up .\nRifts have opened between organisers after tens of thousands of dollars went missing in the aftermath of the Convoy to Canberra protests .\nQuestions are being asked about the $ 320,000 raised for flood support by a group founded by three anti-vaxxers .\nAnti-vaccine business directory website Fair Business Australia

high-dependency unit after suffering a manic episode .\nSome figures like Romeo Georges or Matt Lawson who were big parts of the early movement have left completely or stepped back from personal involvement .\nOthers are facing court for alleged crimes .\nAustralia \u2019 s anti-vaccine movement was gifted the perfect opportunity .\nHere \u2019 s what they leave behind COVID-19 has been the perfect opportunity for the anti-vaccine movement .\nA low-information environment that was constantly in flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules on the fly that took away rights and liberties for an invisible enemy .\nSocial media and technology facilitated the spread of misinformation and conspiracy at a speed and scale never before experienced during a pandemic .\nEven as these conditions fade , the movement \u2019 s lasting influence will be the connective tissue created between the people sucked in by lies and rumours .\nAustralians who were tepid or unsure about vaccine safety are now hooked into networks of conspiracy and extremism via apps like Telegram .\nEven as their white-hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disenfranchised and sceptical , if not outright hostile , of the government and our institutions

Pentecostal Christianity really means and to reveal the hypocrite she considers him to be .\nFierravanti-Wells , a member of the right-wing Catholic grouping of the NSW Liberal Party , told a near-empty Senate chamber that Morrison \u2019 s \u201c actions conflict with his portrayal as a man of faith .\nHe has used his so-called faith as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a man of faith , \u201d she said , he was \u201c adept at running with the foxes and hunting with the hounds , lacking a moral compass and having no conscience \u201d .\nFierravanti-Wells then knitted together Morrison \u2019 s long-standing and close relationship with disgraced Hillsong Church leader , Brian Houston , in a way which others in the Canberra complex have shied away from .\n\u201c We learnt the leader of his Hillsong Church group , Brian Houston , was a mentor to Morrison .\nHouston recently stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was charged with sexual offences .\nIt is noteworthy that , in the past , Houston flew top

Michael Towke \u201d \u2014 the Australian-Lebanese businessman who defeated Morrison in a pre-selection for his seat of Cook and was then subjected to a smear campaign .\nThe sense of religious betrayal was palpable in Fierravanti-Wells \u2019 attack .\nOpening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , the party veteran recalled that she and the NSW Liberal \u2019 s powerful Catholic conservative , David Clarke , had put their votes behind Morrison at a key juncture in his political career \u2014 a decision she now bitterly regretted .\nTo traditional Catholic believers , Morrison \u2019 s brand of Pentecostalism is always suspect \u2014 seen as big on glitz and marketing while lacking in intellectual heft and tradition .\nThey see it as centred on the advancement of self and the acquisition of material wealth , as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLast night that marriage of Morrison \u2019 s fake religion and the fakery of the man came together in one of the most powerful faith denunciations Parliament has witnessed .\nIt was also a rarity in Canberra where political journalists have refused to touch the story of Morrison and his relationship with God , even though it goes directly to the character of the prime minister , as Crikey has detailed since last year .\nThe outgoing senator has performed one final public service : she has finally belled the cat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pretence

.\nMany in this place would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with Scott Morrison .\nLet me give some clarity and context to that history so there can be no misunderstanding .\nIn order to understand the man , it is best to look at his past actions .\nWhile professing to be a man of faith and claiming centre right status , Morrison is a product of the left , having worked for Bruce Baird .\nHe is adept at running with the foxes and hunting with the hounds , lacking a moral compass and having no conscience .\nHis actions conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith .\nHe has used his so-called faith as a marketing advantage .\nWe learnt the leader of his Hillsong Church group , Brian Houston , was a mentor to Morrison .\nHouston recently stood down as head of Hillsong because he was charged with sexual offences .\nIt is noteworthy that , in the past , Houston flew top cover for his paedophile father .\n[ Editor \u2019 s note : Houston was not charged with sexual offences , but resigned after being found to have breached Hillsong \u2019 s code of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tourism Australia , he backstabbed his minister Fran Bailey .\nEventually he was fired from the position .\nAs state director of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party , Morrison honed his manipulative skills when overseeing the Wentworth preselection to unseat Peter King .\nAbout 120 membership applications were rejected to help Turnbull get selected , the person Morrison ultimately backstabbed .\nMorrison might profess to be Christian , but there was nothing Christian about what was done to Michael Towke .\nWhen Morrison made his run for the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Towke , Fletcher and Coleman .\nTowke won the ballot in the first round with 84 votes .\nMorrison got eight votes .\nHaving lost the ballot , Morrison and his cronies went to Sam Dastyari to get dirt on Towke , who had been in the Labor Party for a period of time whilst at university .\nThis dossier of anecdotes was weaponised and leaked to the media to the point where Towke \u2019 s reputation was destroyed .\nI am advised that there are several statutory declarations to attest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that we can \u2019 t have a Lebanese person in Cook .\nThe state executive voted 12 to 11 not to endorse Towke and ordered a modified selection process .\nThe only way that Towke could get political exoneration for a future run was to agree to put his numbers behind Morrison .\nMorrison met with David Clarke and I and promised various things .\nOf course he took our votes and never delivered .\nAfter the selection Towke joined my staff .\nHe subsequently sued the newspapers for defamation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold comfort .\nMorrison , his cronies and the Liberal establishment in New South Wales had destroyed a good , young man .\nI regret the day that Clarke and I agreed to put Morrison into Cook .\nSince then Morrison has never faced a preselection .\nHence the trampling of members \u2019 rights in New South Wales .\nDenying them proper preselections and installing captain \u2019 s picks is classic Morrison .\nHe and his consigliore , Alex Hawke , have deliberately contrived a crisis in New South Wales through a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawke , as his representative on state executive for months and months , failed to attend nomination review committee meetings to review candidates , thereby holding up preselections .\nSpurious arguments were mounted to justify the unjustifiable .\nThe constitution was trashed .\nThere is a putrid stench of corruption emanating from the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party .\nAll of this was under the eye of Philip Ruddock .\nAs a former attorney-general , I am appalled that he has allowed Morrison to bully his way to a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at risk all to save Hawke \u2019 s career .\nThis is what it \u2019 s all about .\nHawke knows that if he faces a plebiscite preselection , he will lose .\nMorrison has railroaded federal executive into setting up not only a committee which endorsed Hawke , Ley and Zimmerman but a second committee which is now endorsing captain \u2019 s picks in seats like Parramatta and Hughes , which were scheduled for preselections this week .\nSo what is the hold that Hawke has over Morrison ?\nGood question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antics in New South Wales .\nDuring a speech advocating for a federal integrity commission , I referred to Hawke \u2019 s activities and the dealings of the Baulkham Hills branch .\nAt a meeting in 2018 , 10 members were admitted to the branch .\nThis was confirmed in text messages from the branch secretary .\nHawke was present at the meeting .\nHe saw what went on .\nI \u2019 m told there is video evidence of the meeting .\nI also have relevant documents , including correspondence sent to Morrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the minutes were falsified to show that the 10 members were not accepted .\nStatutory declarations were provided to counter this falsity .\nThe branch was eventually suspended by state executive .\nThe branch president and secretary , both acolytes of Hawke , refused to provide statutory declarations .\nDespite clear evidence of fraud , Hawke \u2019 s role in this process has never been fully disclosed .\nThe New South Wales state director has sat on this matter for years .\nLegal proceedings are now on foot , and I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required to give evidence under oath to explain his corrupt conduct .\nThere is a very appropriate saying here : the fish stinks from the head .\nMorrison and Hawke have ruined the Liberal Party in New South Wales by trampling its constitution .\nIndeed , I understand at a federal executive meeting Morrison was asked whether he was running a protection racket in New South Wales .\nIn recent months I have kept members of the division updated .\nI have received hundreds , if not thousands , of emails outlining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the party .\nThey want to leave .\nThey don \u2019 t like Morrison and they don \u2019 t trust him .\nThey continue to despair at our prospects at the next federal election , and they blame Morrison for this .\nOur members do not want to help in the upcoming election .\nBy now you might be getting the picture that Morrison is not interested in rules-based order .\nIt is his way or the highway \u2014 an autocrat and a bully who has no moral compass .\nNow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of votes last Saturday and having analysed the data , I know the numbers tell their own story .\nClearly , my push for democracy in the New South Wales division was certainly not welcome .\nThis would mean that the factional operatives can \u2019 t control preselections .\nFor years , figures in the Liberal Party have denied the existence of factions and criticised the ALP .\nThis is hypocrisy , given that the Liberal Party is now no different to the Labor Party .\nIn addition , having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policy matters , I was a marked woman .\nI have known for a number of years of the machinations involving the PMO and others to move me on .\nRecent media reports confirmed a deal agreed to by Hawke , Yaron Finkelstein from the PMO , Charles Perrottet , Dallas McInerney , Trent Zimmerman and Matt Kean .\nIn my case , Dallas McInerney from Catholic Schools NSW was encouraged to run against me .\nRealising he did not have support from the conservative base to win a preselection , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite Molan having promised he would only see out the Sinodinos term .\nIn my case , Wade McInerney , brother of Dallas , worked in my office for five years .\nFollowing his departure to work for Robert Assaf at Greyhound Racing NSW , I discovered he was engaged in inappropriate conduct and activities .\nI was duty-bound to refer him to the Australian Federal Police , the Department of Finance and the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency .\nHaving engaged lawyers and fought hard for a preselection , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support from delegates meant Plan B had to be implemented .\nDom Perrottet \u2019 s premiership is held together by a thread through a so-called unity deal with the Kean-Poulos left .\nFor years the Perrottets have railed against Hawke , threatening to prosecute the Baulkham Hills matter but never delivering .\nThe Perrottets , the McInerneys , Assaf etc had only about 30 votes between them .\nIn the ultimate act of treachery those numbers were press-ganged into voting for Hawke \u2019 s candidate , Molan .\nWhy ?\nIn short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called enemy Hawke to do a deal : Morrison gets his captain \u2019 s picks in federal seats and no state members jump ship to the federal arena , which would in turn have crippled the premiership of a supine and weak state leader .\nIn my public life I have met ruthless people .\nMorrison tops the list , followed closely by Hawke .\nMorrison is not fit to be prime minister and Hawke certainly is not fit to be a minister .", "author": "Concetta

house\u2019: is Scott Morrison living in the same country as the rest of us?", "content": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg pitched his election budget as one tackling the rising cost of living .\nBut he proposed no policies to address one major driver of our inflation uptick \u2014 the rising cost of rent .\nThe price of renting a home in Australia increased last year by the highest annual amount in more than a decade .\nThis included regional areas , where the working-from-home revolution has increased demand and prompted rent rises of up to 25 % in some areas .\nWhen Today host Allison Langdon asked the prime minister about this on Wednesday , Scott Morrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to support people who are renting a house is to help them buy a house.\n\u201d This was widely ridiculed as a Joe \u201c get a good job \u201d Hockey-esque betrayal of elite aloofness and class prejudice .\nBut Morrison \u2019 s comments , and his government \u2019 s lack of rental relief policies , illustrate a specific prejudice shared by many federal politicians : they look down upon renters .\nThey routinely treat renting as a brief waystation on the road to home ownership , instead of a long-term way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be improved .\nThis is despite an increasing proportion ( more than a third ) of Australians renting their homes , for longer periods , due to skyrocketing house prices .\nThis might be easier to swallow if government efforts to support more renters to buy homes weren \u2019 t so limited and ineffective .\nThe First Home Loan Deposit Scheme , which Morrison touted in his Today interview , is likely to provide a marginal benefit to the 45,000 successful applicants , but will further push up house prices and rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both major parties have regrettably walked away from more effective policies for bringing house prices within reach of prospective first homebuyers \u2014 negative gearing and capital gains tax reform \u2014 effectively ensuring that a growing proportion of the population rents their homes .\nYet in nearly every budget , the government announces lukewarm policies pitched at prospective homebuyers , fig leaves used to explain away doing nothing substantive on house prices and even less to improve the cost and conditions of renting .\nRenters rarely even show up as \u201c winners \u201d or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s budget scorecards , for we \u2019 re hardly discussed .\nThere is much the federal government could do to help renters with rising costs if they wanted to \u2014 particularly those who are most at risk of rental stress ( when rent costs more than 30 % of household income ) are those on the lowest incomes , particularly welfare recipients .\nTo address this , a rental assistance supplement was added to various dole payments .\nThe Morrison government recently raised this supplement , but by a minuscule $ 3 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 171.50 for families .\nThis covers less than a third of the average single person \u2019 s rent and a quarter of the average couple \u2019 s .\nEven on the progressive side of politics , the importance of rent assistance is often overlooked .\nThe Greens once supported raising it by 30 % , but failed to mention it in their recent , otherwise commendable welfare package , and Labor has focused on social housing .\nThe Grattan Institute has proposed increasing the supplement by 40 % , and indexing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by people receiving income support , so that its value is maintained \u201d .\nThe Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has also suggested changing eligibility criteria , as out of 1.4 million low-income private renters , only 933,000 receive financial help .\nThis change would be particularly useful for young people and elderly renters .\nAbout 40 % of young people say they struggle with housing costs , compared with 23 % of baby boomers .\nBut for those elderly Australians who don \u2019 t own their home , the Retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes in terms of financial distress and income poverty \u201d .\nMany of our welfare and superannuation policies presume that older people will own their homes , disadvantaging those who don \u2019 t .\nIn the absence of federal action , some state governments have begun helping renters improve their day-to-day lives .\nThe Victorian government , for instance , introduced a renters \u2019 rights package last year , which prevented landlords from unreasonably preventing basic property modifications , owning pets and more .\nMeanwhile , after comedian Tom Cashman \u2019 s story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application revoked for asking for a \u201c landlord reference \u201d , ACT Labor MLA Michael Pettersson ( a renter himself ) is presenting a motion to require landlords to provide a reference from a previous tenant if requested .\n\u201c The federal government must lead a coordinated national housing strategy involving all layers of government and addressing all aspects of housing tenure , \u201d said Farah Farouque , director of community engagement at Tenants Victoria .\n\u201c Short-term fixes won \u2019 t do .\nWe need significant Commonwealth interventions and leadership.\n\u201d Maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation \u2019 s renter support system .\nYou might still be distracted by the \u201c Australian dream \u201d , but those of us living in the new Australian reality would

report shows exports of fossil fuels are expected to reach a record $ 425 billion this financial year \u2014 a 32 % rise from 2020-21 .\nThe increase is purely the result of price rises .\nAustralia \u2019 s exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas ( expected to more than double to $ 70 billion in exports ) and coal ( expected to also more than double to nearly $ 110 billion ) are reaching unprecedented levels , with coal driven both by rises in metallurgical and thermal coal .\nThe surge in gas revenue is due to the forecast price rising to $ US16 per gigajoule .\nThat \u2019 s about $ US12 per metric million British thermal units ( MMBtu ) \u2014 and Asian spot LNG prices have been above this level since the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record $ US48.30 per MMBtu in late December .\nThe remarkable surge in coal revenue \u2014 iron ore has been the only export to ever earn more than $ A100 billion in export income in a year \u2014 is driven by an expected price for metallurgical coal of $ US348 a tonne , up from $ US123 in 2020-21 .\nAgain , this could be conservative : futures prices have coal prices well above $ US400 a tonne for Australian coal from central Queensland .\nNo wonder Resources Minister Keith Pitt leaked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official release .\nAustralia is the world \u2019 s largest exporter of metallurgical coal , but Russia is also a significant exporter , supplying about 30 % of Europe \u2019 s needs .\nIf Europe \u2014 either at government instigation or because corporations fear the taint of links with war criminals \u2014 rejects Russian coal , an already tight seaborne market is going to face further challenges and see prices soar even further \u2014 Chinese , Japanese and South Korean steelmakers will not want to be priced out of the market .\nRussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal .\nThermal coal prices have also surged , with the Australian benchmark Newcastle Weekly Index hitting an all-time high of around $ US436 a tonne in mid-March , before declining to $ 262 this month .\nBut even after that fall , thermal coal prices remain well above the government \u2019 s forecast of $ US193 a tonne for the 2021-22 year .\nThe windfall in export earnings \u2014 achieved with little in the way of increased cost for exporters \u2014 accounts for most of the 9 % rise in forecast company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget , and the 18 % rise in petroleum resource rent tax ( PRRT ) receipts , albeit only to a still-trivial $ 1.65 billion ( we should be earning tens of billions from our gas exports , not sums measured in the hundreds of millions ) .\nTogether , that is expected to pour an extra $ 9 billion into government coffers compared to estimates just five months ago in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook ( MYEFO ) .\nAgainst that , the government is forfeiting around $ 2.5 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut fuel excise because of the surging oil price ( the report predicts oil will average $ US92 a barrel , up from $ US54 a barrel ) .\nBut this is the dirty little secret of the government \u2019 s election bribes : they \u2019 ve been funded with the help of the suffering of Ukraine and the global spike in energy prices that has delivered big windfalls for energy exporters like Australia \u2014 and had real consequences for energy importing states .\nAustralia could give Ukraine 10 times the help we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give ourselves some election bribes \u2014 or maybe actually use the windfall to reduce the still-massive budget deficit .\nBut as Paul Keating could have said , never get between a politician and a bucket of money .",

Kid you not", "content": "Would it concern you to learn that the major political parties in Australia do not exist ?\nI \u2019 m not being existential here , it \u2019 s a real question .\nAccording to some courts , but not others , in a real legal sense they are mere figments .\nMost people would be surprised to know that the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party are not legal entities .\nThey \u2019 re not corporations , incorporated associations , credit or trade unions , friendly societies , chartered institutes or any of the more exotic forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having the same status as an actual person .\nThe parties are unincorporated associations , rather like the tuckshop committee or your footy tipping pool .\nThe law recognises that these creatures exist in a practical sense , but not in a way that gives their members contractual rights against each other .\nThis state of non-existence has advantages ; for one thing , you can \u2019 t sue them .\nIt also means they enjoy fluidity in their internal processes , since their governing rules aren \u2019 t enforceable .\nOf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , the people , because in the modern form of democracy they effectively wield both all the political power and the levers of public expenditure .\nIf it is uncomfortable to think that there \u2019 s a murky insubstantiality to all this , it should .\nBoth parties have been in court lately fighting over the same question : a takeover by the federal party of the preselection processes for candidates in the coming election , overriding the wishes and autonomy of state and local party branches .\nThat is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parachuting party headquarters \u2019 preferred candidates into safe seats against local wishes .\nIn Victoria , Diana Asmar led a group who sued Labor leader Anthony Albanese over his imposing federally selected candidates in that state .\nThat case was decided by the Victorian Court of Appeal in February .\nAlbanese won .\nIn NSW , state Liberal Party representatives took on Prime Minister Scott Morrison , who had done the same thing to them .\nThe NSW Court of Appeal gave its decision yesterday .\nMorrison won too .\nSo far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freaks and bad news for grassroots democracy .\nHowever , the two state appeal courts came to opposite conclusions on a very important legal question : can disputes about the governance of the political parties be litigated in and determined by the courts ?\nVictoria said yes ; NSW said no .\nAnd , rudely , NSW said that Victoria was \u201c wrong \u201d .\nI won \u2019 t go too much into the arcane legal argument which revolves around a High Court case from 1934 .\nThe established principle is that disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made under those constitutions are not \u201c justiciable \u201d ; that is , the courts have no jurisdiction to deal with them .\nThese disputes are deemed \u201c domestic \u201d , meaning it \u2019 s beneath the courts to waste their time with such trifles .\nThe Victorian court felt that the principle , while it used to apply to political parties , doesn \u2019 t these days because the parties have been given a much more prominent and important role in the process of elections .\nTherefore , for electoral purposes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can attract the attention of the courts .\nThe NSW court said you \u2019 re wrong .\nYes , political parties are recognised by the modern Electoral Act , which requires that they be registered and have a written constitution , but that doesn \u2019 t mean they are converted into legal entities .\nThey are still just glorified clubs .\nThe significance is made clear by the NSW court \u2019 s decision , which said that just because a person has been preselected under the party \u2019 s rules to be its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned that means nothing .\nThey become the candidate when the registered officer of the party notifies the Electoral Commission that they are the candidate , and not before .\nThat the registered officer will do so , said the court , is for the candidate a mere \u201c hope \u201d .\nUntil then \u201c the members of his or her party might change their minds \u201d .\nAnd if they do , there \u2019 s nothing to be done about it .\nHmmm .\nThe Liberal Party changing its mind about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened before , I ask rhetorically while reading about Morrison and his preselection rival candidate for the seat of Cook in 2007 , Michael Towke .\nFor the law , it is unattractive that the top courts of the two biggest states are at odds on an important question , and we must hope that the NSW case goes to the High Court so it can resolve the issue of principle definitively .\nIt remains , though , deeply problematic that these ephemeral entities continue to operate as political parties in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from true representative democracy to a system dominated by party machines .\nThese machines control everything that matters .\nThat they are allowed to persist as nonentities is untenable .\nThese unseemly spats over preselection may be just the sewage of politics as usual coming to the surface as it tends to do around election time ; but they have exposed a structural flaw .\nOne thing Liberal and Labor will agree on , though : they won \u2019 t want to do anything about it .\nShould captains \u2019 picks be @ @ @

bringing forward closure dates and the attempted acquisition of AGL by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield , federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor is using the last moments before the election to push through rule changes that would make it far harder to accelerate closure of coal-fired power plants .\nIn a humiliation that illustrated how much the Morrison government \u2019 s refusal to have an energy policy has sidelined it , Origin Energy announced in February it was bringing forward the closure of its deadly Eraring coal-fired power plant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt did so after extensive consultations with NSW Treasurer Matt Kean , then the minister for energy and the environment , but without the climate denialist Taylor having a clue what was happening .\nAn angry Taylor lashed out at Origin at the time , claiming falsely that the closure would push up electricity prices .\nAt the same time , AGL announced it was bringing forward the closure of Bayswater in NSW and Loy Yang A in Victoria to 2033 and 2045 , respectively , though no one outside those companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those dates .\nNow Taylor is seeking revenge on the companies by writing to the compliant Australian Energy Market Commission ( AEMC ) to demand changes to the National Electricity Rules .\nTaylor wants to extend the notice period for the closure of generators from three and a half years to five years .\nThe notice of closure requirement , a recommendation of the Finkel Review , was imposed in 2018 .\nThe previous year AGL had enraged the Turnbull government by confirming the closure of another highly dangerous Hunter Valley coal-fired plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now close by next April .\nTaylor \u2019 s demand for the AEMC to nearly double the length of the notice period , if it had been in place in February , would have forced Origin to keep Eraring open at least another year , despite its obsolescence and the uncompetitively expensive coal-fired power it generates .\nIt would also act as a deterrent to any company bringing forward plans to close the last of Australia \u2019 s ageing and uncompetitive coal-fired power generators , with Taylor looking to prohibit any company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how uneconomic it is .\nThat would function as a deterrent to bids such as that launched by Cannon-Brookes and Canadian infrastructure giant Brookfield for AGL , which would have invested heavily in the company \u2019 s renewable assets and shuttered its increasingly loss-making fossil fuel assets .\nTaylor also wants to prevent owners from getting around the closure notice requirements by deeming mothballing of generators to be effective closure .\nOwners will also be banned from making \u201c speculative notices of closure when the generator has no actual intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date \u2026 to prevent generators from engaging in behaviour that could create uncertainty in the market \u201d .\nThe rule changes also have potentially significant ramifications for AGL \u2019 s splitting of its coal-fired assets into a new company , Accel , from its main energy portfolio .\nShareholders are due to vote from mid-June after an independent expert \u2019 s report on the split .\nTaylor \u2019 s attempt to re-write the rules will complicate the split and make Accel appear less competitive to investors who may be wondering how the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies are reluctant to do business with fossil fuels .\nAnalysts already worry the AGL split might see the proposed value of Accel set so low ( in order to attract investors ) that it destroys some of the residual value in the assets and leaves them stranded .\nTaylor \u2019 s proposal could very well see the independent expert \u2019 s report on the split come down against the deal if the

competing to register web domains that they use to direct voters towards information about themselves and their opponents .\nWhile social media and search engines have rendered domains less important , they \u2019 re still a hot commodity for parties hoping to register certain terms .\nEarlier this week , it was revealed that the Liberal Party had registered albanese.com.au and directed it towards their own party website .\nIt didn \u2019 t take long for Australia \u2019 s web domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to cancel the registration as the domain did not match the registrant \u2019 s details ( i.e .\nthe Liberal Party had no legitimate reason to claim albanese.com.au as its own ) .\nIt was an uncommon move by auDA .\nThere \u2019 s a long tradition of political parties cybersquatting on their opponent \u2019 s names and very rarely does auDA step in .\nRealistically speaking , not owning yourname.com.au is more of a minor frustration than a real electoral obstacle .\nWhen asked about albanese.com.au , Anthony Albanese himself pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupe any voters : \u201c As if someone who is searching for my website is going to go , \u2018 Oh , it is the same as the Liberal Party website \u2019 .\n\u201d Albanese also said the registration of albanese.com.au was a \u201c test of integrity for Scott Morrison and the Liberal Party \u201d .\nIt \u2019 s not clear if he knows that his own party is the owner of domains including NSWLiberals.com.au and MatthewGuy.net.au .\nIn fact , Australia \u2019 s two major political parties have registered hundreds of domains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure .\nBoth of them own endless variations of their own names , such as the LNP \u2019 s libn.at .\nThey also register the names of their politicians , candidates and branches , where voters may go to find out more information about them .\nParties also proactively buy negative domains to stop their opponents from registering them .\nThe Liberal National Party has registered domains including lnpfails.com.au , putlnplast.org.au and lnpcuts.org.au .\nOne of the major uses of web domains is to create standalone campaigns .\nSome are for specific issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche stunts like getagoodjobthatpaysgoodmoneyinjoehockeysoffice.org , a Labor reference to former Treasurer Joe Hockey \u2019 s gaffe of telling first-home buyers to \u201c get a good job \u201d .\nThese domains might offer hints about future campaign slogans .\nAfter an election defeat in 2020 , the Liberal National Party in Queensland registered towards2024.online \u2014 a reference to the next state election in 2024 and a slogan used by deputy leader David Janetzki .\nParties even use them to run sneaky campaigns that may not be obviously associated with them , like South Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of imitating petition platform change.org .\nPolitical party \u2019 s domain registrations offer hints about the plans and messages of political parties .\nThat \u2019 s why Crikey is revealing what they own .\nCrikey is publishing a list of web domains that have been registered using the names of Australia \u2019 s major political parties .\nOne of the key protocols on the internet is the WHOIS protocol , which provides information about a domain , including who registered it , where to send internet traffic for that domain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone can perform a WHOIS search on any website for free ( here \u2019 s Crikey ) .\nThis is like using a flashlight in a dark room : you can point it at one thing at a time to see it .\nThere are other commercial tools that allow people to search a full WHOIS database .\nThis is like a light switch that illuminates the entire room so you can scan it for whatever you \u2019 re looking for .\nUsing one of these tools , Crikey has found 1156 domains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including \u201c Liberal National Party \u201d , \u201c Liberal Party of Australia \u201d or the \u201c Australian Labor Party \u201d .\nA few notes about limitations of the data .\nWHOIS data relies on people volunteering their information while registering a domain , information that isn \u2019 t verified .\nThis means that it \u2019 s open to potential manipulation by someone either listing false details or not including any at all .\nAdditionally , Crikey \u2019 s list of domains relies on the use of the three search terms listed above .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that include typos ( alp.org.au is registered to the \u201c Australian Labour [ sic ] Party \u201d ) or registered to alternate bodies ( domperrottet.com.au is registered to \u201c Bunori Pty Ltd \u201d , a NSW Liberal Party-associated business ) would not be included .\nMany of these domains do not link to active websites .\nThis may be because the website is no longer running in the case of old

\u2019 s preselection .\nNo surprise then that Zimmerman got the lion \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Tink boosted hers to 21.4 % .\nIn key Labor-held marginals Parramatta and Eden-Monaro , there \u2019 s been a shift in media coverage towards the Liberals , as the party finally announced candidates .\nIn the past week , Eden-Monaro challenger Jerry Nockles \u2019 coverage surged to 69.2 % , compared with 28.3 % for sitting MP Kristy McBain .\nIn Parramatta , coverage is deadlocked between Liberal Maria Kovacic and Labor \u2019 s controversial captain \u2019 s pick Andrew Charlton

shareholders set to elect a new management team to steer the fossil fuel giant through what is shaping up as a bumper period of high commodity prices .\nAustralia \u2019 s key controlling investors Woodside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Glencore , Adani and Whitehaven will decide on a new management team to oversee operations in coming weeks , with the remaining ~10 % of voting shares held by Australian citizens expected to play little role in the decision .\nThere are strong market rumours that the incumbent management team led by Scott Morrison will be removed in favour of a new team led by Sydney-born Anthony Albanese ( no relation to former Rio Tinto head Tom Albanese ) , who offers more ESG-friendly credentials while committing to continue the expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , statements this week from fossil fuel investors \u2019 media arm News Corp suggested that Morrison \u2019 s team may be returning to market favour .\nThe incumbent management team has worked hard to increase profits for investors and facilitate the expansion of fossil fuel projects across the large landmass \u2014 just this week , industry division manager Angus Taylor proposed new rules to prohibit the closure of coal-fired power stations .\nHowever , Morrison and his executives have been harmed by a succession of scandals over misconduct \u2014 the embarrassing public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suspension of executives in response to allegations of sexual assault and violence , the rorting of company funds by executives and the persistent rejection by Morrison and his team of efforts to improve accountability and impose performance standards .\nWorst of all , Morrison himself has been repeatedly caught out lying , including to international leaders , and is regarded as overly passive and prone to avoiding responsibility when things go wrong .\nWhile Albanese and his team have been criticised as less likely to generate profits for fossil fuel investors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors through pro-fossil fuel workers \u2019 organisations such as the AWU and the CFMMEU , which are powerful financial supporters of the Albanese slate of executives .\nPreviously a democracy , Australia was acquired by fossil fuel investors in the early 21st century after they purchased the conservative Liberal and National parties and took a strategic stake in the Labor Party ; executives who were regarded as having performed particularly well were rewarded with director positions on a variety of fossil fuel boards , while key regulatory institutions \u2014 especially climate and environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil fuel interests through the appointment of energy and resources executives to key positions .\nThe small stake held by Australian citizens presents occasional tensions for executives , with a large majority of Australians favouring climate action and a curbing of fossil fuels , but fossil fuel executives appointed to key advisory positions within administrative structures act to ensure that tensions are always resolved firmly in the interests of investors .\nIn-house media arm News Corp is also proactive in supporting information-sharing efforts on behalf of fossil fuel interests to counter alarmist anti-carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels in Australia have also proved troublesome ; in regions such as New South Wales ( on the east coast ) and Victoria ( on the south coast ) , investor efforts to acquire governments have proved less successful and those administrations have been poorer at maximising fossil fuel profits .\nNonetheless , Australia represents the world \u2019 s first carbon state outside the oil sheikhdoms of the Middle East , and it has proved a richly rewarding business model for investors .\nThe current commodity price spike has delivered hundreds of billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies with little in the way of additional tax payable to state institutions ; instead , investors enjoy significant financial handouts paid for by other taxpayers .\nThe famous \u201c Land Down Under \u201d may yet have much to teach the world in proper corporate governance .", "author": "Bernard Keane", "url":

campaign trail began on an inauspicious note for Labor .\nFaced with a series of predictable gotcha questions , Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese floundered .\nKicking off the campaign hustings in the ultra-marginal seat of Bass , held by rebellious Liberal Bridget Archer , Albanese couldn \u2019 t name the current cash rate .\n\u201c Over the coming period , the Reserve Bank has said that there will be multiple interest rate increases regardless of who is in government , \u201d he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow-up about the unemployment rate .\n\u201c The national unemployment rate at the

under the constant media glare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammering the opposition leader on his \u201c never having held a Treasury portfolio \u201d and relentlessly trying to frame Labor as incompetent on handling of the economy .\nIn light of another Newspoll showing a slight drop in Labor \u2019 s primary vote , it \u2019 s another sign that despite the opposition \u2019 s strong position , there \u2019 s still plenty of time \u2019 til election day .\nUnforced errors like this one over the six-week stretch might be a struggling government \u2019 s best hope at holding on .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @

responsibility , \u201d Albanese later said .\nElsewhere the prime minister faced pressure of his own , over the future of the permanently embattled Alan Tudge , who stood down from the ministry last year over an alleged abusive relationship with staffer Rachelle Miller .\nTudge denies the allegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Minister , Morrison maintained Tudge is still \u201c technically \u201d in cabinet , and there \u2019 s nothing barring his return .\nIn March , Morrison claimed Tudge was not seeking a return to the frontbench .\nNow his tune has changed .\nMeanwhile , Miller is set to receive a $ 500,000 taxpayer-funded settlement in the fallout .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t confirm that payment .\nI don \u2019 t have any visibility on those issues , \u201d Morrison said .\nMorrison started the campaign in Gilmore , which former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win from Labor .\nIt \u2019 s a part of the country still scarred by the Black Summer bushfires , a time when Morrison \u2019 s tin-eared , evasive response ( he literally fled to Hawaii on a secret holiday ) caused fury around the country .\nAt the time , Constance said Morrison got the welcome he deserved from angry Cobargo residents .\nAsked about those comments , Constance deflected , saying the community just wanted to hear positive stuff .\nAside from the predictable attacks on Labor , Morrison also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture warring .\nHe praised efforts by Tasmanian Senator Claire Chandler and Warringah candidate Katherine Deves to ban transgender women from women \u2019 s sports , and hinted that he could introduce legislation on this in a potential future term .\nOn the whole , not a dream start for Albanese and Labor .\nBut politically unpopular culture warring and the festering sore of Tudge reflect

How to best navigate the upcoming political quagmire on social media", "content": "A hectic place during normal times , Australian social media is really going to turn up the heat during the federal election .\nThe best way to confidently follow election results , avoid misinformation and keep your sanity is to stay off social media for the whole of the election campaign .\nBut where \u2019 s the fun in that ?\nThe University of Canberra \u2019 s Digital News Report 2021 shows that 52 % of Australians access much of their news from social media , while for almost a quarter of us , social media is our primary news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big election \u2014 and the pull of instant analysis , speculation , memes and # breaking news will surely prove too much for all but the most iron-willed .\nSo if you \u2019 re going to have your head firmly stuck in social media this election , here are a few ways to go about it .\nReddit dubs itself \u201c the front page of the internet \u201d and is basically a network of online communities of interest where members submit content and hold discussions on their topic of choice .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world news and as bizarre as birds with arms ( just photoshopped images of birds\u2026 with arms ) .\nThe subreddit r/AustralianPolitics is reasonably well-moderated ( although they don \u2019 t allow articles from sites that have paywalls or political satire \u2014 boooooo ) , but at election time it can get particularly interesting as it holds AMA ( Ask Me Anything ) sessions with some interesting types .\nFor example , on 11 April , 2022 , the Australian Electoral Commission is taking open questions about election processes and procedures .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play out in real time on Twitter , where political journalists , politicians and # auspol enthusiasts converge in one big melting pot of chaos .\nWhile the instant news and hot takes can be quite thrilling , it \u2019 s important to remember there is an Australia beyond Twitter ( thank God ) .\nKeep yourself in check by making sure you follow a bunch of reputable news sources and journos as well as people with very loud opinions .\nAnd if something is going absolutely wild on Twitter and you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , cross-check it with what \u2019 s trending on Google searches .\nNine times out of 10 , the number-one trending item on Twitter is not being searched by the majority of Australians \u2014 it \u2019 s just going nuclear on the app .\nWhen something is really having a big impact on Australians , however , you \u2019 ll see that trend spike on Google .\n( Hint : it \u2019 s mostly sport . )\nSay what you will of Gen Z \u2019 s favourite social media platform , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , announcing in March that it will be launching an in-app Election Guide with the support of the Australian Electoral Commission ( AEC ) .\nThis means any content on the app that references the election will have a little pointer to the AEC \u2019 s election guide \u2014 which lays out things like \u201c verifying your facts \u201d and \u201c how to enrol \u201d \u2014 as well as to its website .\nYou can find election coverage on TikTok by searching phrases such as \u201c Australian election \u201d \u2014 one great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Matilda Boseley , who offers excellent political coverage .\n( And oh , look , Crikey also has a fledgling TikTok if you \u2019 d like to check it out . )\nIf you want to know what \u2019 s actually going on this election , don \u2019 t bother with social media platforms owned by the political parties or their respective leaders .\nHowever , if you want to know what they want you to think is going on , head straight over to the Labor and Liberal Instagram pages\u2026 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you .\nOn Morrison \u2019 s personal Instagram page you \u2019 ll be able to find out which minority group he \u2019 s trying to butter up each week by taking a look at what he puts on his BBQ .\nOver at Albanese \u2019 s Insta you \u2019 ll find plenty of images showing off how good he now looks in a suit .\nThe best thing about politics on Instagram is accounts that have popped up to offer \u201c digestible \u201d news or explainers about what \u2019 s going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out are The Daily Aus ( \u201c accessible news for young Aussies \u201d \u2014 but old Aussies might like it too ) , Left Right Out ( simple explainers of complex political events ) , and Pyjama Politics , which provides behind-the-scenes takes by Guardian Australia \u2019 s Amy Remeikis .\nFacebook is notoriously terrible at dealing with elections .\nIt may have its so-called \u201c misinformation filter \u201d in place , but tech think tank Reset Australia has already tested and bypassed Facebook \u2019 s advertisement filter , placing egregious misinformation graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole lot of political advertising dollars go .\nThankfully , Facebook \u2019 s parent company Meta has the Ad Library , which provides advertising transparency by sharing a searchable collection of all ads currently running on the site .\nIt \u2019 s not super easy to use , but it is a trove of interesting information about how much parties are spending , who are they targeting , and what message they are trying to sell them .\nThe best advice if you \u2019 re going to looking for election information on Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites , make sure the information you \u2019 re being served isn \u2019 t an election ad , and keep the RMIT ABC fact check page up , constantly .\nOf course , Crikey has your back on

was hugely successful in 2019 and could be so again .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s once-massive lead narrowing .\nThe strategy accords with Morrison \u2019 s own style of \u201c governing \u201d , which is to do as little as possible and avoid blame when anything goes wrong , and use announcements and media releases as substitutes for actual policy .\nMorrison has used his leadership to craft a new kind of prime ministership \u2014 in which the incumbent is in power but mysteriously floats above all responsibility , a kind of powerful passivity ; Morrison can never be held to account , but everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s been helped in this by a press gallery that has been reluctant to do the hard work of holding him accountable \u2014 which overlooked his routine lying until Crikey began calling it out , which overlooked his climate inaction and even pretended he had a climate policy , which overlooked his refusal to accept even the most basic standards of anti-corruption safeguards , which ignored his dramatic increase in the size of government , fuelled by a generational debt .\nAlbanese \u2019 s Labor , of course , has declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen did in 2019 .\nIt wants to keep the focus entirely on Morrison , rather than on Labor policies .\nHaving happily been a vehicle for scare campaigns against Labor \u2019 s proposed agenda in that campaign , much of the press gallery is now expressing its frustration at Labor \u2019 s refusal to serve itself up on a plate again .\nAs a consequence , it is declaring that Albanese is \u201c unknown \u201d and has failed to convey who he really is , that voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a target on your back , the press gallery opens fire .\nRefuse to do so , you \u2019 re hiding and can \u2019 t be trusted .\nThat \u2019 s despite John Howard offering virtually nothing by way of policy while heading to a landslide victory in 1996 , except a few promises that , in government , became \u201c non-core \u201d .\nThen again John Howard was a known quantity in 1996 \u2014 he \u2019 d been in Parliament for 22 years .\nAnthony Albanese has only been in Parliament for\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that

two-party system ; despite generations of smaller parties and independents wielding significant influence in the Senate , the idea of minority governments is still portrayed as a kind of political

struggle with change .\nAt ease with small , siloed but professionalised major parties and narratives based around personality , political journalists have visibly struggled with grassroots movements

often assuming it \u2019 s a sort of monolithic , unified movement when it is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions of many political journalists , some Voices Of groups don \u2019 t even endorse the high-profile independent standing in their seats .\nThe assumption of journalists is that Voices Of groups must be a type of political party , because they \u2019 re used to only thinking in terms of political parties , and it \u2019 s usually a good rule of thumb for politics .\nIn this case , it happens to be badly wrong .\nTwo versions of that thinking have been on display this week : one risible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Downer , still doing his spot-on Boy Mulcaster impersonation after all these years , this week termed \u201c so-called \u201d independents as \u201c little more than the most loathsome example of pork-barrel gangsters \u201d , which is a fine jape given the Morrison government \u2019 s world championship title for rorting .\nBut Downer goes on to argue that these

, he evidently believes only Liberals \u2014 and , he might graciously allow , Nationals and Labor \u2014 should be allowed to stand for office , which is apt for a man who belongs in the Tory party of Stanley Baldwin .\nThe unsubtle implication is also that the best contribution the likes of Helen Haines and Zali Steggall and Zoe Daniel and Kylea Tink and Allegra Spender could make is to get out of the way and let the blokes get on with it .\nDifferent from , but not unrelated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective of David Crowe for Nine newspapers .\nCrowe understands the significance of the independents , beginning his column yesterday with \u201c the old ways of Australian politics are about to be tested \u201d .\nBut the urge to turn everything into a party-like monolith was too strong for Crowe , who says \u201c the unifying thread at this election is the funding from a different activist group , Climate 200 , and its leader , Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court , one of the most relentless opponents of the government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not about female independent candidates , it \u2019 s about a man \u2014 the agency of the candidates , and of the movements they have emerged from with their thousands of participants , falls away in the shadow of Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court , who , if not pulling their strings , is the string connecting them .\nCrowe argues that , if successful , independents \u201c will sweep moderate Liberals out of Parliament while leaving conservatives untouched .\nThe Liberal Party room would shift to the right.\n\u201d That is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be seen through the prism not of those communities but through the hollowed-out major party it will affect .\nIn any event , that analysis is wrong and self-defeating .\nThe independents exist because

Australian state , including the Coalition and much of the ALP .\nThat \u2019 s why independents have emerged , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c moderates \u201d , the Liberals would be exactly the same , just without Dave Sharma regularly backgrounding The Sydney Morning Herald about how unhappy he is to be rolling over yet again to the denialists .\nPolitical parties are not the purpose of politics

Albanese\u2019s unemployment rate fail does matter", "content": "Election campaign stumbles and \u201c gaffes \u201d are beloved of journalists .\nFor a start , engineering one is far easier than actually being across policy substance and understanding the contrast between a party \u2019 s policy position and the public interest .\nAnd rather than the complexities of actual policy , they enable journalists to present the much simpler and clearer narrative that a politician is \u201c out of touch \u201d .\nThat \u2019 s what Scott Morrison copped back in January when he was unable to say what basic groceries cost \u2014 a facile question that even regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone the prime minister .\nThat \u2019 s what Anthony Albanese got yesterday when quizzed about the current interest level and the unemployment level .\nAlbanese \u2019 s team had no excuse .\nThey \u2019 d seen what happened to Morrison , and Albanese should have known everything from the price of a litre of petrol to the average variable mortgage rate from the major banks and everything in between .\nMost gaffes don \u2019 t have much impact , and certainly not as much as journalists think .\nVoters sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent that they \u2019 re paying any attention .\nBut journalists seem to think there \u2019 s some magical cadre of undecided voters stroking their chins and checking the transcripts of every campaign media conference in order to assess who has gaffed the most before deciding whom to support .\nBut the nature of Albanese \u2019 s stumble is genuinely weird .\nWho does not know that the Reserve Bank of Australia has interest rates set at 0.1 % ?\nApart from anything else , it \u2019 s an almost comically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the late 1980s , as Albanese is .\nAnd who doesn \u2019 t know that unemployment is verging on record lows ?\nBoth figures are central to two Labor campaign themes around wages growth and cost-of-living pressures , since low unemployment is yet to translate into higher wages and the likely imminent rise in interest rates from near-zero is going to inflict damage on the household budgets of mortgage holders .\nFor someone engaged in serious debate wages , household incomes and cost-of-living pressures , not knowing such basics is inexplicable .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the label of economic inexperience on Albanese , claiming he \u2019 s never delivered a budget before .\nIt \u2019 s an asinine argument \u2014 how many budgets had Bob Hawke delivered before 1983 ?\nFor that matter , how many had Tony Abbott delivered in 2013 ?\nAnd yet there was Albanese seeming to give the line substance .\nOne of the lessons of 2019 for Labor should have been that any complacency will be fatal .\nThere \u2019 ll be no cruising to victory .\nThe three biggest media companies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven \u2014 are all owned or controlled by Liberal-aligned figures .\nABC News is too cowed and craven to be balanced .\nLabor spokespeople every day walk out into a hostile media environment .\nAnd Scott Morrison will say anything he needs to make Labor the subject of the campaign , not himself .\nHe was brilliant at it in 2019 and he \u2019 ll do the same all the way to May 21 .\nAlbanese at least owned up to the mistake and didn \u2019 t try to avoid blame .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to from Morrison , who will never admit to even egregious mistakes or stumbles .\nBut he shouldn \u2019 t expect that will win any plaudits for that either .\nBetter that the Labor team does its homework properly in the first place .", "author": "Bernard Keane", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/04/12/albaneses-gaffe-does-matter/", "published": "Tue, 12 Apr 2022 01:38:15 +0000", "published_utc": 1649741895,

crucially important election campaign , Scott Morrison wanted to talk about trans people .\nUnprompted , the prime minister brought up the defining policy of his handpicked Liberal candidate for Warringah and co-founder of Save Women \u2019 s Sport Australasia , Katherine Deves .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bShe \u2019 s standing up for something really important , and that is to ensure that , you know , when it comes to girls playing sport and women playing sport , that they \u2019 re playing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s , that \u2019 s , I know it \u2019 s a sensitive issue \u2013 , \u201d Morrison said before being interrupted by host Chris Smith , and returned to it after the interjection to say he shares Deves \u2019 views .\nMorrison and Deves know exactly what they \u2019 re doing when they bring up trans women in sport .\nAustralians overwhelmingly support the rights of trans people .\nA YouGov poll conducted for Equality Australia in July 2020 found that four in five Australians agree trans people deserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut conservative political campaigners have identified trans people as a potential wedge in people \u2019 s support for the LGBTIQA+ movement .\nAt a conference in 2021 , Australian Christian Lobby director Martyn Iles called transgender people \u201c where the lie is most fragile \u201d .\nIn the UK and increasingly the US , the rights of trans people have become a bigger and more popular culture war topic .\nTrans women in sport specifically has been a target for anti-trans campaigners .\nAustralian anti-trans group Binary published a poll that found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouldn \u2019 t compete against biological females \u2014 however , it is worth noting that the group did not name the polling firm and it is difficult to assess just how reliable these results are versus an established pollster like YouGov .\nBut we know from credible polls in the US that support for trans women in sport is a lot more contested , like this 2021 Morning Consult poll that found 40 % of people supported trans women competing at collegiate level sport versus 42 % who opposed .\nBut talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s specifically about women \u2019 s sport \u2014 isn \u2019 t as popular as talking about whatever the government is doing on the economy or how it \u2019 s recovered from COVID-19 .\nPlus the number of people who it actually affects is vanishingly small : less than 2 % of Australians are trans and not all of them play sport .\nThe deletion of Deves \u2019 Twitter account just before the election and the lack of mention of trans women or sport in her Liberal Party website biography may hint at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue .\nPunters in the pub , around the dinner table , aren \u2019 t spending all their time talking about it .\nSo why is Morrison talking about it ?\nWell , he has a track record of bringing it up .\nLess than a month after becoming PM , Morrison responded to an article in The Daily Telegraph about NSW teachers being taught to recognise children questioning their gender by tweeting \u2014 again unprompted \u2014 his opposition : \u201c We do not need \u2018 gender whisperers \u2019 in our schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has previously been vocal in his support for an anti-trans sport bill private member \u2019 s bill from Senator Claire Chandler , a rising star in the Liberal Party who has staked her flag to campaigning against trans women in sport .\nPlus the Morrison government was all too happy to use transgender school children as a wedge when attempting , and ultimately failing , to pass its religious discrimination legislation through Parliament earlier this year .\nThe sudden appearance of moderate Liberal MPs coming out of the woodwork to \u201c express concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t proof that this was Morrison freelancing .\nThis is the government \u2019 s attempt to be all things to all people : Morrison , Chandler and Deves are sending a signal to a more conservative base worried about gender and the \u201c wokeism \u201d bogeyman , whereas senators Andrew Bragg and Simon Birmingham are smoothing it over by saying that there \u2019 s nothing to worry about .\nAll of this article has been about politics , but debates about trans people doesn \u2019 t just concern politicians .\nIt affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most marginalised and socioeconomically disadvantaged .\nThey are at higher risk of suicidal ideation , self harm and mental health issues .\nThey \u2019 re the ones who have to hear their identity and rights debated by the national media , despite it really affecting very , very few people .\nThey will , no doubt , be chilled by a promise from the prime minister on the campaign trail on Monday : \u201c I \u2019 ll have more to say about that at another time .\n\u201d", "author": "Cam Wilson", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/04/12/morrison-deves-trans-gender-women-in-sport/", "published": "Tue, 12 Apr 2022 01:35:30 +0000",

Interest rates v the price of bread", "content": "When is a gaffe front-page news ?\nWhen it \u2019 s day one of a six-week election campaign and nothing much else has happened apparently .\nAs we cover elsewhere in Crikey today , yesterday Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese was asked what the current interest rate level and the unemployment level were and he came up empty-handed on the numbers .\nIt drew comparisons to Prime Minister Scott Morrison \u2019 s start-of-the-year brain fart when he couldn \u2019 t tell reporters the price of bread , petrol or RATs .\nBut are these mistakes cut from the same cloth ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLet \u2019 s travel back in time to February 1 .\nOmicron is on the rise , people \u2019 s Christmas and new year have just been wrecked by the evil strain with

\u201d schtick is wearing thin .\nThen it gets absolutely blown apart when he can \u2019 t put a price to a loaf of bread .\nHow unAustralian is that ?\nFormer Liberal prime minister John Howard , reporters were quick to point out , used to carry an up-to-date list of cost-of-living prices around in his folder for such a time as these .\nThe general consensus ( online at least ) was , yes , it was a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn \u2019 t have done a better job at illustrating how out of touch he was with voters if he \u2019 d told them to eat cake .\nSo what was different about what happened yesterday with Albanese ?\nWeirdly , he had a few things working , if not exactly for him , then not against him .\nFirst , as Bernard Keane writes elsewhere in Crikey today , yes , it \u2019 s a question he should have absolutely known the answer to .\nBut not being able to rattle stats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head is ( a bit sadly ) quite relatable .\nAlmost like Kevin Rudd \u2019 s trip to a strip club in New York City , it just kinda makes him seem normal .\nPlus Albanese apologised later the same day ( the same day Morrison couldn \u2019 t name the price of milk he also refused to apologise for not doing more about the COVID-19 situation ) .\nSecond , Howard ( hello again ! )\ntold reporters he didn \u2019 t think it mattered a bit that Albanese didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of support from across the aisle .\nThird , if you look at stats about leader \u2019 s \u201c share of voice \u201d yesterday , Albanese was in the lead .\nNot bad for a man who we \u2019 re constantly being told is a cardboard cut-out with no vision or personality .\nAlbanese dominated headlines yesterday and while it wasn \u2019 t all good ( David Crowe in the SMH made some huge claims about just how bad this would be for Albanese ) , not all of it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the Labor leader \u2019 s gaffe brought back memories of Morrison and the price of bread shows that not all gaffes are equal , but in an election campaign they \u2019 re all on the table .\nAs Christopher Warren wrote in Crikey , for the media the election campaign started yesterday .\nBut the pollies have been

revised from outright dismissiveness to a healthier scepticism that should have prevailed all along .\nFirst and foremost is the track record that international market research giant YouGov has accumulated over three state elections since it took over from The Australian \u2019 s venerable Newspoll series in late 2019 .\nElection eve polls in Queensland , Western Australia and South Australia were all broadly on the money , allowing for a margin of error that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe biggest errors were underestimates of the Labor primary vote by 2.6 % in Queensland and 2.9 % in WA

wheels first started to wobble at the Victorian election in 2018 , it is , so far at least , a record that any international pollster might envy .\nThe second positive sign is that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm bells in 2019 even before the result laid bare the fact that the entire industry had followed Newspoll off a cliff .\nAll five polls of national voting intention in the last week of the 2019

the Nine newspapers \u2019 Resolve Strategic series \u2014 which had some anomalously Coalition-friendly polls late last year but hasn \u2019 t done so since \u2014 the post-budget period has produced a fairly healthy spread from 53-47 in the weekend Newspoll to 57-43 in the latest Roy Morgan .\nWith that established , we can take a deeper look at what the pollsters are telling us with confidence

potentially double-digit swing .\nKnowing this is likely to cost them three seats and their majority , the Liberals have invested hope in a glut of Labor-held seats on threadbare margins in NSW , although you may not have known it from the way the party handled its preselections there .\nHowever , none of the pollsters are offering much encouragement for this , recording Labor swings in the state of at least 4 % .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ high base in Victoria appears weaker , the consensus is that it should at least be sufficient to gain it the Melbourne seat of Chisholm , while keeping the wolf from the door in its own marginals .\nLabor \u2019 s state election triumph in SA also appears to have fed into federal polling from that state , which doesn \u2019 t bode well for the Liberals in the marginal Adelaide seat of Boothby .\nAs ever , the great enigma is Queensland , which was ground zero of the polling failure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s two-party vote there by 8 % .\nHome to four Coalition-held seats on margins of less than 5 % , it \u2019 s the state where pollsters are offering the widest spread of results .\nWhereas a recent aggregated quarterly result from Newspoll had the Coalition leading 54-46 , for a relatively modest Labor swing of 4 % , the debut poll from Ipsos for The Australian Financial Review last week had it the other way around , allowing for a smaller sample and a 4.4 % margin of error .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the campaign began , with the Coalition \u2019 s hopes resting either on a second polling failure or a campaign dominated by strokes of

to seek permission to hold an election \u2014 dominated political coverage .\nAlbanese \u2019 s stumbles on the unemployment rate and interest rates were the third-biggest issue in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of living and inflation .\nMorrison \u2019 s wrestle with the NSW branch of his own party and the various legal actions associated with it was fourth .\nThereafter several issues that all favour

insisting Tudge did nothing wrong and will return to cabinet .\nIsentia also noted that although by no means dominant , Morrison \u2019 s 1.3 million jobs pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 despite being easily demolished by genuinely independent journalists .\nAgain unsurprisingly , Morrison and Albanese dominate media coverage , though the prime minister had more than twice the volume of mentions ( positive and negative ) as the opposition leader , especially online .\nEveryone else was a footnote \u2014 but along the names earning some mentions were Clive Palmer , Tudge , Andrew Constance and Barnaby Joyce .\nLabor \u2019 s Treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers has had an unexpectedly obscure start to the campaign , coming in below housing and regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ALP campaign HQ team .\nThe PM \u2019 s decision to start his campaign in the Labor marginal of Gilmore helped elevate Constance to a dominant position in coverage in that seat over Labor \u2019 s Fiona Phillips .\nIn Braddon in Tasmania , however , Labor \u2019 s challenger Chris Lynch substantially boosted his media coverage against the Liberals \u2019 Gavin Pearce .\nIn Bass , Labor \u2019 s Ross Hart dramatically picked up his media game against Bridget Archer on the back of Albanese \u2019 s visit \u2014 who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost from Morrison , though she found herself in the middle of intensive questioning about Morrison \u2019 s broken promise of a federal ICAC .\nIn Eden-Monaro , Labor \u2019 s Kristy McBain blitzed her opponent in coverage , making grant announcements in the coastal town of Narooma .\nFor North Sydney , mentions of Trent Zimmerman still dominate , although positive mentions of independent opponent Kylea Tink lifted .\nIn terms of the emotional pulse of social media , sadness and disgust were both higher than long-term averages , particularly sadness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s refusal to consider an increase in JobSeeker .\nIsentia also has a fascinating metric on the proportion of time the parties devote to speaking about their own policies versus attacking their opponents .\nOn that score , Albanese and Chalmers have so far been more positive , talking about their policies 57 % of the time , compared with 46 % for Morrison and Josh Frydenberg .\nThere are also some highly revealing metrics about what the different media organisations cover in terms of

candidate for Warringah and anti-trans women in sport campaigner Katherine Deves had a history of extreme , online transphobic comments , I wasn \u2019 t surprised .\nThat \u2019 s because I recently spent several weeks observing multiple online spaces for women who don \u2019 t believe trans women are women .\nThese women fit into a branch of feminism called trans exclusionary , or \u201c gender critical \u201d , radical feminism ( also referred to online as TERFs ) .\nBorn out of radical feminism in the 1970s , the movement persists online , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupied with transgender people \u2014 to the exclusion of almost any other subject or area of concern .\nBefore I began researching , I suspected that the radical feminist rhetoric I was occasionally seeing on Twitter was only the tip of the iceberg , and not representative of the younger cohort of radical feminists who preferred other platforms like TikTok and Discord .\nOnce I started looking , I found young women talking about women \u2019 s sports , women \u2019 s bathrooms , women \u2019 s changing rooms , lesbians being forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities not being real .\nI saw users praising plans to legislate which bathrooms trans people can and can \u2019 t use , and I saw people praising Texas Governor Greg Abbott \u2019 s decision to order child welfare officials to investigate parents who were allowing their children to receive gender-affirming care .\nI observed spaces on online platforms Twitter , TikTok , Giggle , Spinster , Ovarit and Discord .\nTwitter , TikTok and Discord are mainstream platforms you \u2019 re probably familiar with .\nThe other three are less widely known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re platforms created by radical feminists specifically to talk about things that would see ( and have seen ) them expelled from other platforms .\nOvarit was created in 2020 in direct response to Reddit \u2019 s crackdown on hateful subreddits , which saw r/GenderCritical and any associated subreddits removed from the site for violating its rules against promoting hate .\nThe \u201c girls only \u201d app , Giggle , was launched by Australian Sall Grover in 2019 , and made headlines in 2020 because of its verification process : you \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app can determine that you \u2019 re female .\nLast month , a complaint was filed against Giggle with the Australian Human Rights Commission in regards to their ban on transgender women .\nSpinster , billed as a radical feminist-friendly alternative to Twitter , was created by MK Fain in 2019 .\nPopular users of Spinster include Graham Linehan and Meghan Murphy , both of whom have been banned from Twitter for violating the platform \u2019 s rules against posting hateful speech .\n( The UK-based Linehan posted in support of Deves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging his readers to engage with her critics on Twitter ) .\nIt was on Discord , an instant-messaging app initially made popular by gamers , that I encountered the most hateful content : users rating transgender women \u2019 s profiles on dating apps and sharing fantasies about raping and murdering men and transgender people .\nI also encountered racist and anti-immigration rhetoric , particularly against Muslims , whom they see as particularly patriarchal and harmful to the cause of women \u2019 s rights .\nI found that the quality of discourse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TikTok was worse than I \u2019 d previously thought .\nRather than censor themselves entirely , users had instead become more adept at getting around filters and censorship , i.e .\nby simply making new accounts whenever theirs were removed for violating community guidelines , or by making use of \u201c Algospeak \u201c , or by using obscure lingo that moderators with little knowledge of the radical feminist community would have scant hope of parsing , such as \u201c TIM \u201d for \u201c trans-identified male \u201d ( in other words , transgender women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist \u201d , or the train and knee emojis paired together to represent a common transphobic slur .\nThis is the environment that Deves would have found herself in when she was active on Twitter .\nAs a cofounder of Save Women \u2019 s Sport Australasia who claims to have worked with Senator Claire Chandler on legislation that would see trans women excluded from women \u2019 s sports , Deves is precisely the kind of online culture warrior I encountered time and time again .\nIf the number of tweets about trans people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now-defunct Twitter account seems high , it shouldn \u2019 t ; the one thing that stood out to me was that the more time people spent in these spaces , the more they focused on trans people while other causes fell to the wayside .\nIndeed , for many so-called feminists who would typically consider themselves centrist or left-wing , transphobia served as a good enough reason to celebrate the work of conservatives like Chandler or Deves , or like Texas \u2019 Greg Abbott .\nCam Wilson pointed out that Deves \u2019 biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a \u201c women \u2019 s advocate \u201d , but \u201c if there \u2019 s another aspect of her work in this area it \u2019 s certainly not public , nor has she advertised it \u201d .\nWomen like Deves believe that arguing against the inclusion of transgender people in public life is enough to be the sum total of their activism ; concerns like reproductive health or the wage gap are consistently ignored while they engage in their tenth conversation that day about a hypothetical trans person using the changing room @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Catherine Bouris", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/04/20/katherine-deves-representative-of-online-transphobes/", "published": "Wed, 20 Apr 2022 06:05:45 +0000",

s , biggest gas companies \u2014 and thus the theft from Australians of income from our own natural assets \u2014 should be front and centre in the election campaign , given the colossal deficits and debt Australia currently faces .\nAs Crikey reported last year , the PRRT is a colossal rort \u2014 taxpayers are actually receiving less now than they were 20 years ago despite the massive expansion in gas exports from Western Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra revenue offshore gas companies are enjoying .\nOnly Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and the massive spike in energy prices it caused \u2014 finally bumped PRRT revenue up in the forecasts in the April budget .\nBut those forecasts remain below the levels of 20 years ago .\nNew data compiled by the Greens as part of their proposal for a new super-profits tax on the sector reveals the shocking extent to which the rules of the PRRT , which allowed accumulated deductions from exploration and construction to artificially grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) plus up to 15 percentage points , have inflated deductions .\nThe government changed the rules marginally in 2019 to reflect that offshore gas projects take much longer to come online , and thus generate much bigger accumulated deductions , so that deductions would only grow by the LTBR plus 5 points for a decade , at which point they \u2019 d only grow by the LTBR .\nBut the damage was already done to taxpayers \u2014 and is now embedded in the PRRT system .\nThe Greens have found in Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deductions available to gas companies is $ 282 billion \u2014 or around 13 % of GDP .\nEvery single dollar of those deductions means a dollar less in PRRT payable .\nThat \u2019 s why we now get less in PRRT revenue than we were getting in 2000 .\nAnd that \u2019 s why , according to the Tax Office , gas companies won \u2019 t be paying any PRRT until the mid-2030s \u2014 even as they reap astonishing export returns worth over $ 100 billion a year .\nIn fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never pay any PRRT on its profits from the Gorgon or Prelude fields .\nThe biggest contributors to PRRT returns are oil companies : BHP and Esso \u2019 s Bass Strait projects .\nIt means that foreign companies are making huge profits from Australian resources , without paying Australians anything for their use .\nAnd these companies also pay little or no company tax \u2014 again because of their expert use of deductions .\nLike US-owned ExxonMobil , owner of 25 % of the Gorgon project .\n$ 15.5 billion in revenue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company tax : zero .\nPRRT paid : zero .\nOr US-owned Chevron , owner of 47 % of Gorgon , 64 % of Wheatstone and 16.7 % of the North-West Shelf .\n$ 15 billion in revenue .\nTaxable income : $ 169 million .\nCompany tax : zero .\nPRRT : zero .\nOr British-owned Shell , owner of stakes in NW Shelf , Gorgon and Prelude : $ 5.3 billion in revenue ; zero taxable income , zero company tax , zero PRRT .\nWoodside , at least , pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue , $ 3.1 billion in taxable income , $ 454 million in tax , no PRRT .\nAccording to data sourced by the Greens , 28 gas companies collectively earning $ 77 billion in revenue and $ 482 million in taxable income paid no tax in 2019-20 .\nRemember these numbers are all wildly out of date : the revenue of these companies has more than doubled in the past six months , with little change in their costs , but because of those hundreds of billions in artificially inflated deductions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRRT and little in the way of extra company tax .\nThe Greens want to dump the failed PRRT with a new system that would wipe out the accumulated deductions in one year , leaving none to be carried forward .\nThere would be no uplift for any further expenditure , which would be deducted over 15 years .\nThey also want a deductible 10 % royalty applied to offshore gas projects other than the NW Shelf .\nThe Parliamentary Budget Office says the Greens proposal would generate $ 90 billion in additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue that is currently flowing , mostly , to foreign shareholders for Australian assets .\nThe fact that the Greens are the ones bringing this idea forward says a lot about the extent of state capture of Australia by fossil fuel companies .\nAt a time of massive budget deficits and a likely trillion-dollar debt , neither major party is interested in preventing the loss of revenue that belongs to Australians to foreign shareholders .\nIt \u2019 s left to the Greens to do the hard policy work that would make life uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s

News Corp newspapers and websites this morning .\nNews.com.au \u2019 s Samantha Maiden wrote that Perrottet denied leaking the texts , suggesting that it was the prime minister \u2019 s office \u2014 an exceedingly common occurrence for his \u201c private \u201d communications .\nRegardless of where it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison \u2019 s backing of Deves , makes life awkward for NSW Treasurer Matt Kean after his public intervention and , perhaps most importantly , tries to centre the public debate around the issue of trans women in sport .\nBut that \u2019 s not what the past week of coverage has been about .\nThe attention on Deves has been because she spent years publicly espousing transphobic views to anyone who would listen .\nShe tweeted thousands of times , she made public submissions linking being transgender to autism , she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only reprehensible but also flat-out wrong .\nThose arguments that gender transition will be used by sexual predators and paedophiles are cribbed straight from anti-gay arguments from the 1970s .\nThe reaction to Deves has been because of her lies , her disgust and her obsession with a marginalised group that she gladly broadcast when the bright lights of election scrutiny weren \u2019 t on her .\nIf it \u2019 s not clear from the above , Deves \u2019 advocacy on trans women in sport is only part of her interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of 2020 after she had already co-founded Save Women \u2019 s Sport Australasia , she said as much : \u201c This is my very great interest , fighting against this gender identity

around the world have spent years figuring out how to handle the intricacies of gender and competition .\nThese policies are still being worked on , but also something that is well within their domain

\u2019 t make any sense .\nImportantly , it \u2019 s not something that women in sport want either .\nSport researchers Erik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who played rugby union expressed strong support for inclusion of trans women .\nFewer than a quarter of women club sport athletes in another survey thought trans women had an unfair advantage .\n( You know who were about twice as likely to think trans women had an unfair advantage ?\nMen . )\nSo if women in sport want trans women to be included \u2014 and noting that trans women are a quite a small part of the population , and their participation

Labor held a 10-point primary vote lead over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit among men .\nIt should also be noted that the Coalition \u2019 s concerns about the women \u2019 s vote do not begin and end with Labor .\nIn a string of traditional blue-ribbon seats , male Liberal incumbents are under pressure from female independents who are nearly as keen to point out their opponents \u2019 association with

debacle of the now-formalised agreement between China and the government of the Solomon Islands has forced Morrison onto the defensive on what was supposed by the press gallery ahead of the campaign

at Bellerive Oval in order to debate Labor \u2019 s Clare O \u2019 Neil .\nAlso sharing Payne and Colbeck \u2019 s panic room in the Coalition fortress of solitude is Attorney-General Michaelia \u201c Chuckles \u201d Cash , whose unique and apparently involuntary laughter has sadly been absent from the campaign so far \u2014 despite Morrison promising to attempt a do-over with the industrial

to delve into the heart of federal marginal seat Chisholm , in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne , to see what people are thinking about in the lead-up to the polls .\nThis first piece sets the scene for what is shaping up to be one of the key battlegrounds for the election .\nAmong the most marginal electorates in the country \u2014 held by Hong Kong-born Liberal Gladys Liu on a wafer-thin

with oaks , planes and eucalyptus .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with umami smells , bubble teas and Asian grocers .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re thinking about the landscape of Victoria , it \u2019 s probably the key battleground seat , \u201d Paul Strangio , politics professor at Monash University , says .\nThe electorate \u2019 s 77 square kilometres are proudly diverse \u2014 local leaders frequently boast about its cultural credentials .\nIt \u2019 s home to a greater share of residents born in China , India , Malaysia , Sri Lanka and Greece than the national average , ABS data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic powerhouse taking in the health , education and industry clustered around Monash University , Victoria \u2019 s second-largest employment hub after the CBD .\nThe area \u2019 s diversity reflects waves of migration , initially from post-war Europe then from China , India , Vietnam and Malaysia .\nMonash and Deakin universities bring high concentrations of international students .\nCensus data show half of Chisholm households speak a language other than English at home , with the largest share \u2014 15 % \u2014 speaking Mandarin .\nCompared with the national average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly younger , less religious and more educated .\n\u201c We always proudly say that 50 % of our residents were born overseas \u2014 which is astronomical , \u201d Monash mayor Stuart James says .\nThe Liberals narrowly held the seat at the past two elections .\nIn 2016 , Chisholm was the only electorate in the country to change from Labor to Liberal , under candidate Julia Banks .\nIn 2019 , the party held on by 1090 votes , after preferences .\nLabor will be targeting it hard , Strangio says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , previously an assistant secretary at Victorian Trades Hall Council and reportedly a surprise pick .\nRecent redistribution changes shunted Chisholm \u2019 s boundary southwards , making the seat more marginal , according to ABC election analyst Antony Green , adding in parts of Labor-leaning Clayton and Liberal-inclined Wheelers Hill .\nWhile campaigning has been fierce in electorates such as Kooyong and Goldstein , courtesy of challenges to high-profile Liberal members by well-resourced Climate 200 independents , in Chisholm there \u2019 s no sign of a teal-coloured disruptor as the campaign begins .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashpoint elsewhere , as the campaign kicks off in

station 3WBC .\nOutbreaks of high-rise residential and commercial development , and the increasing density of dwellings , is an issue that \u201c bugs most people \u201d , he says .\nThough suburbia is often synonymous with security and comfort , that \u2019 s not the case any longer , says Amaroo Neighbourhood Centre coordinator Janine Saligari .\nShe sees many households struggling with the rising cost of living , the lack of affordable housing and access to public transport .\n\u201c Not everyone has a car , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their car , \u201d she says .\nDemand for emergency food relief offered during lockdowns has unexpectedly continued , she adds .\nHousing stress affects around 21 % of households renting in Chisholm , an ABC analysis found .\nThe recovery from COVID-19 has

the aged care and childcare sectors .\nHe \u2019 s crunched the numbers for which party offers the best childcare deal .\nThe results are a little bit of a surprise .\nHe explains his finding here and on his blog , entitlemate.com It \u2019 s interesting that on any given day financial columns of newspapers will be filled with questions and technical analysis around retirement and superannuation , but the complex government rules around childcare get very little attention .\nLet \u2019 s cut straight to it : Labor offers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in care , or if you have two children in care and one of them is younger than six .\nIf this is your situation , look no further .\nThe deal is better .\nHow much better ?\nWell , that depends .\nSee the tables below .\nThe right-hand side shows how much the difference in subsidy could be .\nIf your family is in a different situation , it is nowhere near as straightforward .\nUnder the Labor proposal , the childcare subsidy percentage reduces to zero at a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current Liberal policy cuts off support altogether at $ 355,000 .\nThat \u2019 s a new cohort of families \u2014 those earning between $ 355,000 and $ 530,000 a year \u2014 that will get government support if Labor wins the election .\nMaximum subsidy available for long day care per child , per year .\nThe amount is derived by applying the applicable childcare subsidy percentage by the hourly rate cap for the maximum 100 hours per fortnight , over 52 weeks .\nTwo children in care ?\nTake a closer look Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in care under six years old .\nLiberal policy \u2014 changed as of March 7 this year \u2014 means a second child ( if the first one is younger than six ) gets a 30 % uplift in the subsidy rate , to a cap of 95 % .\nUnder the current system , if a family earns $ 200,000 and has two children under six in childcare , the subsidy percentage is 50 % for the first child and 80 % for the second child .\nThe average rate of subsidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; under the Labor proposal , each child gets a flat rate of 66 % .\nIn Table 2 you will see that for families with two children in care and whose income is less than $ 125,000 , the maximum childcare subsidy is almost the same between the parties .\nIn other words , vote Labor or Liberal , there \u2019 s no difference .\nFor families with income between $ 125,000 and $ 355,000 , the best outcome depends on income \u2014 with both parties winning at different levels .\nLiberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal if your family income is between about $ 225,000 and $ 325,000 .\nLabor wins at the other levels .\nTable 2 : Maximum annual childcare subsidy for two children under six Maximum subsidy available for long day care per child , per year .\nThe amount derived by applying the applicable childcare subsidy percentage by the hourly rate cap for the maximum 100 hours per fortnight , over 52 weeks .\nThree kids in care ?\nVote Liberal ( unless you earn over $ 355,000 ) What about three kids ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better for lower-income families with three children under six in care .\nIn fact , the Liberal policy is going to be better for ( almost ) all income levels below about $ 355,000 if you have three kids .\nThe reason is the 30 % increase in subsidy above the Liberal rate for the second and third child under six is high enough to beat Labor \u2019 s flat rate .\nFor example , a family with an income of $ 200,000 will qualify for a 66 % rate under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , the first child qualifies for a rate of 50 % and the next two children get an extra 30 percentage points \u2014 so each at 80 % .\nThe result is a higher maximum subsidy .\nTable 3 : Maximum annual childcare subsidy for three children under six Maximum subsidy available for long day care per child , per year .\nThe amount derived by applying the applicable childcare subsidy percentage by the hourly rate cap for the maximum 100 hours per fortnight , over 52 weeks .\nSubsidy is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formula when calculating support for childcare , with a few inputs based on your family situation .\nYour family income is where the percentage comes from .\nThe percentage is applied to an hourly cost of childcare , where the limit is currently $ 12.31 per hour for long daycare , and a lower amount for other kinds of care , such as family day care and before- and after-school care .\nAbout 15 % of childcare providers charge above this rate per hour ( and in some areas much higher ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not go as some families hope .\nThere is also a limit to the number of hours the government will subsidise , which has a maximum of 100 hours per fortnight .\nA family may be eligible for 50 hours in a week \u2014 but may use a childcare provider that is open for 11 hours a day \u2014 meaning that a five-day week is 55 hours , more hours that the subsidy can reach .\nThis is all complicated stuff , and there are plenty of quirks in how individual families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we assume families have all their children in care for the same amount of time , and for the same cost .\nThis may not always be the case .\nAn example would be an older child who may be in after-school care and the younger child in an expensive room , say , for babies under 12 months .\nWhat happens here ?\nServices Australia does the work for you to outline a number of situations where the current Liberal system can provide significant , and unexpected , benefits to families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older child ( but still younger than six ) is in cheaper after-school care , the younger child in centre-based childcare can take advantage of the higher subsidy .\nThis is important to note , as this whole story is not just about having all your children in childcare centres \u2014 although the story changes once the oldest turns six .\nThe higher-subsidy child in care for more days This example ( from the Services Australia website ) suggests that the \u201c standard rate \u201d child \u2014 the one with the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for fewer days , with the younger , more-subsidised child in for longer .\nThis means the child with the higher cost of care can also attract the higher rate of subsidy .\nIt is important to note that all the advantages of the present ( Liberal ) system disappears when the older child turns six .\nWhen this happens , the Labor policy offers the better deal .\nSo many parts of the system are subject to ongoing , rigorous , well-resourced analysis by professionals and the media .\nBut this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps .\nIf you are going to vote on the basis of cheaper childcare , make sure you work out which system is going to be cheaper for you .\nNote : The childcare subsidy percentage is not simply applied to your childcare costs .\nThe percentage will be applied to the lower of your hourly rate or the hourly rate cap .\nThe number of hours that will be subsidised will be based on your activity and are capped .\nIf you are working in areas where childcare costs are higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centres are open more than 10 hours per day , you have a whole lot of other things to consider when working out how the system supports you .", "author": "Brendan Ryan", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/04/21/childcare-labor-liberal/", "published": "Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:01:31 +0000", "published_utc": 1650513691,

\u2019 s Tim Murray , is a thoroughly decent bloke who speaks fluent Mandarin , works as an investment analyst and campaigns for affordable housing and public education .\nAs befitting the occasion , the two candidates were very polite to each other , the knives only coming out when someone asked Spender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event of a hung Parliament .\n\u201c I haven \u2019 t made up my mind ,

.\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell them , \u201d he snapped .\nAsked about Zali Steggall \u2019 s comment that she would find it easier to support a Liberal Party without Scott Morrison at the helm , Spender

issues for the Coalition pile up", "content": "Anthony Albanese and Labor had a significantly better election campaign over Easter , with the opposition leader lifting his profile and the campaign being dominated by issues favourable to Labor .\nBut the latest Campaign Insights data provided by Isentia to Crikey shows the Coalition was having success in pushing national security into the election narrative \u2014 at least until it was derailed by the Solomon Islands debacle .\nIn the days prior to the leaders \u2019 debate , Medicare and a federal ICAC dominated election coverage , with both issues unfavourable to the government \u2014 especially with Scott Morrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility to a worthwhile integrity body .\nThe cost of living and inflation \u2014 contested issues that the government may feel will work in its favour \u2014 was the third highest in terms of volume of mentions , ahead of border security , a clear winner that the Coalition , and its media allies , sought to push hard during the week .\nClimate , the Solomon Islands and aged care were the next most frequent issues \u2014 all of which play better for Labor than the government .\nIn the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Morrison , who was forced into games of denial on what he knew about the Solomons , while aged care and the NDIS came further to the fore .\nAt the same time , Albanese finally hit his stride in terms of campaign coverage \u2014 something likely to be derailed by his COVID isolation .\nFrom Morrison dominating coverage the previous week , with nearly two-thirds of all coverage about the prime minister , Isentia shows Albanese in the past seven days moved to a 48 % share of coverage \u2014 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure unengaged voters are more familiar with the Labor leader .\nAnne Ruston also had a good week , being the third most mentioned politician after the leaders \u2014 although much of the coverage was about Ruston \u2019 s claim that Medicare was not sustainable , flagging funding cuts when she takes over as Coalition health minister .\nAfter that , the transphobic Liberal candidate for Warringah Katherine Deves was the next most mentioned politician \u2014 remarkable given that she has been completely silenced by the Liberal Party ( while Morrison insists she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence of Deves suggests that Morrison \u2019 s deliberate ploy to use her as a transphobic culture war touchstone might yet bear fruit \u2014 though at what cost to surrounding Liberal MPs in Sydney , who have refused to show the guts of NSW \u2019 s Matt Kean and demand her disendorsement , remains to be seen .\nInterestingly , Jim Chalmers , one of Labor \u2019 s best performers in the campaign so far , also lifted his profile and was substantially ahead of Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in media mentions \u2014 ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose main contribution was to claim that the Solomon Islands was now our own Cuba .\nUnlike Joyce and Frydenberg , Chalmers also racked up strong numbers for television appearances , as did Labor \u2019 s Penny Wong , who has been outperforming Peter Dutton .\nIndeed , Dutton has been a consistent underperformer in the campaign so far \u2014 is all the negative focus group polling about him leading the Liberals to keep him under wraps ?\nIn Wentworth , Isentia shows beleaguered MP Dave Sharma increased his share of coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that increase was negative coverage ; similarly , Monique Ryan has increased her share of coverage in Kooyong against Frydenberg , but mostly as a result of News Corp \u2019 s fossil-fuel-industry-driven hit jobs on her .\nConversely , Bridget Archer in Bass and Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney both upped their coverage game \u2014 but again , much of it was negative .\nAnd just to show how extraordinarily biased some outlets can be : during the week , the leading issue in coverage by Kerry Stokes-owned Prime Media was still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign \u2014 and it was more than twice as much as the volume of coverage devoted to it by the next biggest source , News Corp.

labour scheme under which participants can bring family members , and a new class of permanent migration visa \u2014 these form the core of the policy , along with an unspecified \u201c Pacific

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese thought enough of it to take over RA \u2019 s old frequencies after the Guthrie-era ABC ditched them .\nThe possible restoration of RA drew mockery from Morrison , who offered a line sent fresh in from the hard-working kitchen of the prime ministerial brains trust : \u201c I sent in the AFP , the Labor Party wants to send in the ABC when it comes to their Pacific solution .\nThey have a Q+A solution in the Pacific.\n\u201d A tad harsh , one might think \u2014 at least given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could be sure the peoples of the Pacific would be getting a suitably pro-Coalition perspective on regional events .\nBut Morrison , who presumably thinks \u201c soft power \u201d comes from a wind turbine , is still stranded , Tom Hanks-like , in the Pacific himself , with journalists \u2014 perhaps in between Morrison yelling \u201c Wilson !\n\u201d at Peter Dutton \u2019 s head \u2014 continuing to ask pesky questions about the biggest foreign policy failure since Iraq .\nIn particular , Morrison \u2019 s claims of a \u201c red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solomons continue to prompt questions about what , exactly , Morrison meant \u2014 especially given the United States , via the splendidly named Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink , declined to rule out military force if China established any kind of force projection potential in the Solomons .\n\u201c It would not be responsible for me to speculate in public about what Australia , United States and others would be doing in circumstances such as that ,

LNP candidate , backed by Barnaby Joyce , claiming that the famous net zero by 2050 commitment \u2014 that figleaf for climate inaction much beloved of the press gallery \u2014 in fact was no longer

@ @ @ of T-shirts , a first run of corflutes and some office rent , \u201d she says .\nOther than Climate200 money , the campaign relies on small \u2014 and a handful of larger \u2014 donations

well after its 7.30pm finish time to be in Orange \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 for the 5am Anzac dawn service .\nThe playbook for Hook , and her fellow independents , is one worked up by Cathy McGowan , who successfully wrested the Victorian county seat of Indi from Liberal Sophie Mirabella in 2013 .\nAfter holding the seat for two terms , McGowan oversaw a successful succession to Helen Haines , another independent , who has been the main driver in Canberra for a federal anti-corruption commission .\nIndeed , McGowan \u2019 s book Cathy Goes to Canberra , and one by her sister Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s needed by independents to take a good shot at office .\nMcGowan has also been touring regional seats like Calare with journalist and former ABC presenter Kerry O \u2019 Brien , supporting independent candidates with well-attended \u201c democracy \u201d forums .\nAs well as Hook , there are strong , climate-minded independent challengers down the eastern seaboard , including Suzie Holt in the south-west Queensland seat of Groom , Hanabeth Luke in the NSW northern rivers seat of Page , Caz Heise in Cowper on the NSW mid-north coast , Penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NSW seat Hume , and a rare male independent Rob Priestly in the Victorian seat of Nicholls centred around Shepparton .\nAnother former federal independent MP , Tony Windsor , who held the seat of New England from 2001 to 2013 and was one of the three crossbenchers who supported Julia Gillard \u2019 s minority Labor government from 2010-13 , is supporting both regional and city independents personally and through his involvement with Climate200 .\nWindsor says that although he believed many of the city independents have better chances of winning , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially true because , as Hook has found , many traditional Nationals voters believe the party has deserted them for the mining sector , something conceded by leading Queensland National Matt Canavan last year .\nThe other demographic Hook is finding supportive are women : \u201c Women want to see more women in Parliament , \u201d she says .\nFarmers who want stronger action on climate change , and new , younger voters , are also warm to a

concerns raised by voters at Lowe \u2019 s winery are education , the city/regional health disparity that plagues rural Australia , immigration to feed the need for workers in agriculture and hospitality , and aged care .\nOne of the most thorny issues discussed was the path from coal to renewables , all the more important for a town like Mudgee that Lowe \u2019 s proprietor , David Lowe , describes as being \u201c hooked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense among attendees of dissatisfaction with both major parties , a theme echoed in a Crikey straw poll of Mudgee locals at Kelly \u2019 s Irish Pub earlier in the weekend .\nGee \u2019 s primary vote fell 9 % in 2019 , but he did have 47 % of the vote .\nHook \u2019 s chances received a boost last week .\nThe Shooters , Fishers and Farmers Party

pact that \u2019 s continuing to cause Scott Morrison enormous grief .\nToday \u2019 s instalment is from Andrew Shearer , the long-time Coalition adviser elevated to director-general of the Office of National Intelligence in 2020 .\nAustralia \u2019 s failure to be aware of the pact , he said this morning , \u201c wasn \u2019 t an intelligence failure , this strategy has been unfolding for a number of years .\nI think for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of this well over a decade ago , and we \u2019 ve seen this building presence\u2026 \u201d \u201c Signs \u201d are what the rest of us can read .\nOur intelligence agencies , especially ASIS , aren \u2019 t paid and given extensive powers to tell us what \u2019 s in the Solomon Star ; they \u2019 re not employed to give us a sense of the vibe , but to provide intelligence on a regular basis .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine a definition of \u201c intelligence failure \u201d that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important negotiation between a major power and a small neighbour .\nBut to take Shearer at his word , what does it mean that intelligence services were aware of \u201c signs \u201d of a \u201c strategy [ that ] has been unfolding for a number of years \u201d ?\nIt means \u2014 a conclusion would prefer not to be drawn \u2014 that the government was fully cognisant of what China was attempting to do but complacent , or incompetent , about preventing it .\nWhat advice did intelligence services , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment of Australia \u2019 s climate inaction ?\nOr the self-interested nature of so much of Australia \u2019 s aid , or its neo-colonialist behaviour toward regional governments ?\nDid they also drink the Kool-Aid about how much we \u2019 re loved by \u201c our Pacific family \u201d ?\nOr were these issues left to the diplomats of an increasingly sidelined Department of Foreign Affairs , under the low-impact , low-energy Marise Payne ?\nShearer \u2019 s comments merely make the case stronger for declassifying the intelligence \u2014 as Crikey has previously urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or conducting an inquiry into the failure .\nSuch an inquiry also needs to address the aftermath of failure , as intelligence agency heads moved to evade responsibility for it \u2014 in particular , anonymous claims made to press gallery stenographers that the leak of the agreement draft on March 24 was the work of Australian intelligence agencies .\nIf the claim is correct \u2014 or even suspected to be correct \u2014 it has placed under suspicion anyone connected to the leaking of the draft , which was first posted online by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Suidani .\nIn effect , Australian intelligence sources are giving both the Solomons and the Chinese governments pointers as to who is connected to Australian agencies like ASIS in the region .\nA check of phone logs and email traffic might readily verify the identity of someone who has been acting as a source for ASIS anonymously until now .\nArguably , it was reckless of journalists to publish the claims , and certainly reckless for intelligence officials \u2014 who are supposed to understand the value of protecting assets \u2014 to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflect blame from agencies makes it all the worse .\nIt might also suggest that if agencies like ASIS had trouble knowing what was happening before , they \u2019 ll have an even more difficult time if sources suspect they may be outed to soothe the egos of intelligence chiefs in Canberra .", "author": "Bernard Keane", "url":

\u2019 s foundations are being stretched to breaking point .\nThe latest challenge to the uneasy alliance between urban moderates who drive Teslas and a more reactionary rump enamoured of coal and culture war came \u2014 as it often does \u2014 in the form of Matt Canavan .\nYesterday the Nationals senator unilaterally declared net zero emissions by 2050 \u201c all over barring the shouting \u201d , just hours after Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared it was the government \u2019 s \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave away so much to get the Nats on board with a pretty vague net zero plan just six months ago , Canavan \u2019 s intervention was pretty unwelcome , and puts to bed the government \u2019 s spin about ending the climate wars .\nBut the intervention was utterly predictable .\nFreed from the shackles of ministerial ambition , Canavan can sit on the backbench and post about his love for coal .\nLast year he remained opposed to net zero until the bitter end , even as the Nats partyroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several of Canavan \u2019 s Liberal and Nationals colleagues tried to downplay or dismiss his comments ; former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack agreed it was time for the senator to pull his head in .\nThe government would want Canavan to put a sock in it because the response from \u201c teal \u201d independents mounting a credible threat to moderate Liberal MPs in affluent urban electorates like Wentworth , North Sydney and Goldstein was predictable .\nThey \u2019 ve long argued the Morrison government isn \u2019 t serious about emissions reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deniers in the National Party .\nCanavan makes their case even stronger .\nBut the senator \u2019 s comments , toxic in Woollahra , might play a bit better in central Queensland seats like Flynn , where the LNP candidate Colin Boyce ( correctly ) identified the government \u2019 s net zero plan as a \u201c flexible \u201d one which left wriggle room .\nBoyce is on record opposing net zero right after the Nationals agreed to it last year .\nThe problem for the government is obvious .\nMorrison owes his 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock anti-Labor swing , driven by fears about a Shorten government \u2019 s plans for the coal industry devastated the opposition .\nBut the electoral map has changed .\nThe challenge from the independents is more potent and widespread .\nEven if none win , it forces the Liberals to drain resources towards defending seats they \u2019 ve never lost , and somehow come up with a message that satisfies miners , coal executives , and Tesla-driving tree tories .\nIt \u2019 s this struggle of keeping together the broad church that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated , with different Liberals and Nationals playing to their different bases .\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg , seen as more palatable in the cities despite a serious challenge to his own seat , has been trying to campaign against the teals .\nMorrison , seen as a master on the hustings , is trying to pitch himself as the everyman who can unite the factions and sell both visions of a Coalition future .\nIn Rockhampton today he was accusing Labor of trying to introduce a \u201c sneaky \u201d carbon tax .\nCanavan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition has its back .\nThat Joyce didn \u2019 t join the PM today despite being in Rockhampton and still hasn \u2019 t campaigned with him shows just how toxic he is in much of the country , even if he and Canavan \u2019 s anti-net zero message is useful in Flynn .\nBut that high-wire act of trying to sing a different tune to different parts of the country could all become a little too hard for the Morrison government .\nA similar problem emerged over Morrison \u2019 s support for embattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some as a 5D chess move to win social conservatives in the suburbs while sacrificing the leafy seats , which the polls show could be failing .\nMore generally , the last parliamentary term came to a tense , cantankerous end , characterised by legislative stagnation and rebellion from moderates and conservatives alike .\nThe broad church is feeling the strain , and it \u2019 s going to get a lot more than campaign spin to keep it all together .", "author": "Kishor Napier-Raman", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/04/27/matt-canavan-and-the-problem-of-the-coalitions-broad-church/", "published":

much of that money came from financier Simon Fenwick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neill family .\nIn the same cycle , Advance spent $ 2 million on political ads , mostly on social media .\nSince January it has been the 11th biggest Facebook ad spender on social , political and electoral issues \u2014 ahead of Climate 200 and the Liberals ( who don \u2019 t even crack the top 20 ) .\nThe ads show the group

16.6 percentage points between December 2013 , the first quarter after Tony Abbott was elected , and December 2021 .\nBut CPI has risen 16.8 points in the same period , meaning workers have gone slightly backwards in real terms .\nEven if we round that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , which means workers are significantly out of pocket in terms of cash in hand .\nAnd with yesterday \u2019 s 2.1 % inflation rise in March , it means ordinary workers will need a truly stunning wages surge to go close to breaking even in real terms for the March quarter .\nEven a shock 1.5 % WPI rise for the quarter would leave workers on lower real pay than they were when Kevin Rudd lost to Abbott \u2014 the last WPI number , for December , was 0.7 % quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of 2021 .\nThat WPI number will be released on May 19 , just three days before the election \u2014 which could turn out to be very appropriate timing .\nAnd under Prime Minister Scott Morrison , workers have made no headway in the three years since the December 2018 quarter , and will end up deep in the red after the March quarter numbers are determined .\nThis means Morrison will be the first prime minister to see wages materially go backwards on his watch .\nSince John Howard ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime ministers have presided over inflation and wages coming out about equally .\nThe best performer was Julia Gillard , who oversaw cumulative real wages growth of 0.3 % in total .\nIf Morrison loses on May 21 , he is likely to leave office with the worst record of all .\nYesterday \u2019 s result means that the government \u2019 s March economic forecasts for wages are already in danger of becoming irrelevant .\nThe budget forecasted CPI growth of 4.25 % over 2021-22 , which means there will need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually zero , in the current quarter to meet the target .\nThe government is attempting to engineer that fall with its cut in fuel excise ( on top of falls in the oil price ) , but mitigating against that will be a rise in housing costs driven by the expected increase in interest rates for homeowners .\nWhat \u2019 s noteworthy about yesterday \u2019 s inflation data \u2014 and what will alarm the Reserve Bank \u2014 is how widespread price rises were .\nAlthough housing and fuel led the rises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial items in the household budget \u2014 also rose strongly , showing that both goods and services and tradeable and non-tradeable areas of the economy are affected .\nWhether the RBA moves next Tuesday or waits a month , there \u2019 s no doubt workers with mortgages now face the nightmare scenario of their purchasing power falling materially while mortgage repayment costs increase \u2014 and most likely by amounts large enough to inflict real damage on family budgets .\nIn other countries , workers have banked significant real wage increases since 2018 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ from before the pandemic and through it to late 2021 , when inflation began rising .\nUK workers saw significant real wages rises in 2019 and early 2020 , and real wage growth \u2014 despite surging inflation \u2014 has endured even in recent months .\nThis means US and UK

been appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the RBA has previously said it wouldn \u2019 t lift rates until wages growth rises significantly .\nThat is , Frydenberg is saying , there \u2019 s no case for a rate rise now , given wages growth \u2014 as a consequence partly of the government \u2019 s own policies \u2014 remains mired in pre-pandemic stagnation .\nBut Frydenberg is being disingenuous .\nThe RBA

financial markets brought forward its expectations of rate rises from 2023 to mid-2022 .\nBut the rapid rise in energy costs globally , supply constraints and then Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine further changed the RBA \u2019 s thinking .\nIn April it ditched \u201c patient \u201d .\nConsider the last two paragraphs of the April board minutes : These developments have brought forward the likely timing of the first increase in interest rates .\nOver coming months , important additional evidence will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labour costs .\nConsistent with its announced framework , the Board agreed that it would be appropriate to assess this evidence and other incoming information as it sets policy to support full employment in Australia and inflation outcomes consistent with the target .\nThat additional evidence arrived on Wednesday , and it clinched the case \u2014 whether the rise is in May or June isn \u2019 t important .\nBut from Morrison and Frydenberg \u2019 s point of view , it is absolutely crucial that it be June .\nFor all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow magically encourage people to vote for the government that is presiding over them , a rate rise on Tuesday will be a body blow to the Coalition \u2019 s campaign \u2014 even if only because the mainstream media think it will be and will portray it as such .\nWith Frydenberg going further than any recent treasurer in

.\nAfter the past two years of COVID-related lockdowns , he feels increasingly disenfranchised by the two major parties .\nHe \u2019 s disappointed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID , mostly around its ineffectiveness against state-enforced restrictions .\nBut ask Zervides about Labor \u2019 s chances of ever earning his vote again , and he doesn \u2019 t mess about .\n\u201c Even if I had an inkling to vote federally for Labor , I would never , just because of Dan Andrews \u2026 I \u2019 m so disgusted by the way we have been governed [ in Victoria ] the past four years .\n\u201c I don

South resident for 24 years , Cooke , 49 , says support for the NDIS will be central to winning her vote .\n\u201c I \u2019 m really interested to see what Labor will say they are going to do ,

address the NDIS , which it says is aimed at putting people with a disability \u201c back at the top \u201d of the scheme , may be exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The NDIS would appear to be a priority shared by many voters .\nLabor \u2019 s Anthony Albanese and Prime Minister Scott Morrison traded blows over the scheme at the first leaders debate in Brisbane on April 20 , with Albanese accusing the

Although she doesn \u2019 t feel well informed , she thinks a lack of detail about local candidates is making it harder to choose .\nGarland , the former Victorian Trades Hall assistant secretary , is

interview with him with less than 24 hours \u2019 notice , leaving our political reporter Roman Mackinnon and me with little time to prepare .\nBut the interview went ahead , and it went well .\nThe two major issues were simple : the truth , and how Labor is actually different from the Liberal Party in terms of policies .\nThat first point was something we brought up with Scott Morrison too , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albanese .\nFirst , we looked at Albanese \u2019 s comments that he was \u201c not Scott Morrison \u201d and \u201c doesn \u2019 t run away from press conferences \u201d .\nJust days after saying that , he walked out of one after only eight minutes as journalists continued to try to ask questions .\nWhen Roman asked if he had broken his promise , the Labor leader gave a direct answer : \u201c Not at all.\n\u201d He went on to defend his comments , which you can see in the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him \u2014 at the very end of our discussion \u2014 that if he becomes prime minister would he own up to mistakes and factual inaccuracies if he made them , and whether he would come on 6 News again .\nOn that first point , he indirectly mentioned his gaffe regarding the unemployment rate , and said : \u201c We can do much better than that.\n\u201d On the second point , he says it would be a \u201c pleasure \u201d to return to 6 News .\nThe other main point was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what Labor is \u2014 because traditionally the Coalition has been called centre right and Labor centre left .\nAlbanese said that was a \u201c fair assessment \u201d .\nIn a follow-up question , I asked what separates the ALP from the Liberals in terms of real policy differences , citing Albanese saying the party was not ditching offshore processing , it supported boat turn-backs , had made no commitment to an increase in JobSeeker payments if elected , and the fact that it would essentially abandon a previous plan to review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Albanese says he can \u2019 t understand why some voters \u2014 especially on the left \u2014 label Labor \u201c Liberal lite \u201d , and spoke about having \u201c a plan \u201d .\nOverall , the interview was polite , respectful and in-depth \u2014 like the one with the PM ( although with fewer interruptions ) .\nWe asked the tough questions and pushed for answers , but also let Albanese respond without cutting him off .\nFor the record , the interview is slightly longer than Morrison \u2019 s because Albanese actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only see one preelection interview with the Labor leader this campaign , make it this one

body .\nA draft report into a major branch-stacking scandal that has already cost several ministers their jobs in a government that has become a byword for scandal .\nAnd yet barely a ripple in the federal election campaign .\nWhen The Age \u2019 s Nick McKenzie and Sumeyya Ilanbey reported last week on a draft Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission ( IBAC ) report into the Victorian Labor Party , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way to conclusions about systemic unethical behaviour approved by the party leadership , you could have fairly expected it would crop up during the campaign .\nEspecially with the Coalition in terrible trouble in Victoria \u2014 this week \u2019 s Morgan poll shows Labor leading 63.5 % to 36.5 % there .\nVoters readily distinguish between state and federal issues , but who could resist the opportunity to link Victorian Labor with federal Labor , especially given Deputy Opposition Leader Richard Marles has been a target of the government for

its toxically close relationship with the rotten Crown casino empire \u2014 is the current leader .\nBut Scott Morrison \u2014 or any federal conservative , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the federal Coalition is hopelessly hamstrung by its own opposition to anti-corruption bodies .\nHaving derided state-based anti-corruption bodies as \u201c kangaroo courts \u201d , the prime minister could hardly use a draft IBAC report to attack Labor .\nEspecially after NSW premier Dominic Perrottet criticised Morrison \u2019 s attack on the NSW body and suggested a little respect might be in order .\nMorrison \u2019 s position is now blank refusal to establish a federal independent commission against corruption , having not even produced a bill for one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state anti-corruption findings against a Labor figure would immediately invite the question of what he \u2019 s so afraid of that he won \u2019 t establish a federal one .\nMorrison \u2019 s entire strategy on a federal ICAC during the campaign is to hope people don \u2019 t mention it .\nThe issue attracted considerable coverage during the first leaders debate but dwindled rapidly afterwards as issues like cost of living began to dominate .\nAny oxygen for the issue is also a blessing for teal independents who are campaigning hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s all campaign fun and games as far as it goes , but there are some real-world consequences .\nThe Victorian Liberal opposition is so mind-numbingly inept and so extreme that it has taken Victoria to the brink of a one-party state .\nIt \u2019 s hard to think of a scandal big enough that would have Victorian voters looking at Matthew Guy and his Liberal colleagues with anything other than incredulity .\nAndrews and his rotten government are getting a

his 2019 election win , decided to rail against an \u201c ill-defined borderless global community \u201d and \u201c negative globalism \u201d .\nLike most Morrison neologisms \u2014 especially the notorious \u201c can do capitalism \u201d , which didn \u2019 t last 24 hours \u2014 it was soon abandoned .\nA year later , Morrison was praising multilateralism .\nHis latest invention is \u201c

decisions that impact [ sic ] the lives of Australians from one end of the country to the other .\nI actually think there \u2019 s a great danger in that.\n\u201d That \u2019 s a strange change of tune from Morrison .\nThe day before that interview , in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison was rubbishing the idea of elected representatives doing things needed in their communities , like helping people into home ownership .\nOn the one hand , politicians are some monstrous invasive species that shouldn \u2019 t be allowed near the reins of power ; on the other , the only people who can be trusted to do the right thing .\nThe richer irony was that it was on the very day the \u201c public autocracy \u201d of the Reserve Bank lifted interest rates .\nIf the prime minister seriously thinks \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger \u201d then he should immediately revoke the Reserve Bank \u2019 s independence and make monetary policy a function of Josh Frydenberg \u2019 s hopelessly politicised Treasury , where elected representatives can direct it \u2014 not faceless officials in Martin Place .\nHe should also propose a referendum to get rid of the High Court and the Federal Court \u2014 nothing but \u201c faceless officials \u201d \u201c making decisions that affect the lives of Australians from one end of the country to the other \u201d there .\nFar better to have politicians deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional issues .\nIs this taking a sensible idea to an absurd extent ?\nNo , it \u2019 s to point out we already have what Morrison calls \u201c public autocracy \u201d but is more accurately called \u201c independent experts \u201d right through our system of government .\nAnyone trust politicians to decide court cases ?\nCommand troops on the battlefield ?\nRegulate industries ?\nRun public broadcasting ?\nOf course not .\nWe recognise that politicians don \u2019 t have the expertise and can \u2019 t be trusted to act independently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected .\nIn fact , why have independent regulators at all ?\nJust faceless officials making decisions that affect lives .\nGet rid of them .\nPoliticians should do it .\nMorrison will also need to get rid of the military command of the ADF .\nWho are these faceless generals controlling our military services and leading our troops ?\nLet \u2019 s get elected representatives in to run the military too .\nIn recent decades we \u2019 ve come to understand that we need more \u201c public autocrats \u201d , not fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shibboleth of the neoliberal right \u2014 arose in the 1990s because of the belief that politicians couldn \u2019 t be trusted to lift interest rates when that was needed to combat inflation .\nDuring the pandemic , Morrison and his fellow politicians fell over themselves to insist they were merely following the advice of health experts .\nAnd in Sydney , where corruption of local councils by property developers was so endemic , not merely were property developers banned from donating to politicians , local councils were stripped of their power to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning panels do it .\nThat is , we \u2019 ve decided that politicians have proven themselves untrustworthy .\nThey \u2019 re too easily bribed ; their desire to be reelected makes them ignore the public interest ; they \u2019 re blinded by their own ideological obsessions .\nSo they need to have less power .\nAnd part of the push for a federal ICAC , and for the reining-in of pork-barrelling and rorting , is driven by the fact that the Morrison government is the most corrupt in federal history , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted to act in the public interest .\nThe great danger is in allowing them access to power at all , not letting them have more .", "author":

or he\u2019ll end up beating himself", "content": "This article first appeared in InQueensland .\nWhen Scott Morrison fronts the media , it is as planned , scripted and risk-assessed as everything else the Liberal leader does .\nHe has , in his famously self-identified \u201c flow-brain \u201d ( a pop psychology term for total immersion in an activity ) , the data and word pictures needed to sell the day \u2019 s offering .\nMorrison also has in front of him a shuffle of papers with double-spaced notes on everything his campaign team thinks might be raised by journalists looking for an angle or finding some soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , juggling papers and reading from them word for word .\nIt \u2019 s a sensible approach , reducing risk and minimising the opportunities for the media to find a gap , a hole or a contradiction .\nMost of the time it works , helped by Morrison \u2019 s formidable ability to bluster with word salad that often collapses into gibberish .\nIt \u2019 s all done with such self-belief and confected conviction , even the nastiest gotcha lazy journalist is left without a line of sight on what actually happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away with it but he has been given the benefit of the doubt since the pandemic kicked off two years and two months ago .\nAll of this was a construct , like everything else this 24/7 political being does .\nLearning from the way John Curtin handled the media during World War II , Morrison brought the leaders of the press gallery into the sanctum \u2014 they were given the deepest \u201c off the record \u201d background briefings with Health and Treasury officials .\nThe briefings were very regular at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week .\nThrough this relationship \u2014 which Curtin used to make sure the national media didn \u2019 t threaten the security of the war effort \u2014 Morrison protected his own personal and political security .\nIt wasn \u2019 t about protecting the health and economic safety of the nation but had a sole aim of controlling and owning the daily narrative to the single advantage of the most political and ambitiously driven prime minister the country \u2019 s ever seen .\nAt the same time , Morrison entrenched a polling program that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , assisted by publicly-funded surveys tracking attitudes to various programs and trends .\nThis is the never-ending campaign machine Morrison carries around with him , in his head and in those pages on his lecterns .\nIt is the complete melding of the campaign director ( Morrison ran the Liberal \u2019 s New South Wales branch for more than half a decade ) .\nThe data might change but the mission never wavers \u2014 searching for the binary choice , dividing and conquering and to the winner the spoils , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called \u201c genius campaigning \u201d by some but it \u2019 s actually a very narrow set of skills .\nA close look at how Morrison moves , behaves and speaks in this campaign , and lining it up against what he did in 2019 , shows there is not much difference , which is its purported brilliance and also its potential weakness .\nThis background provides insight into the way Anthony Albanese is handling himself during this campaign and how it \u2019 s being presented in the media .\nAlbanese has had genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve Bank cash rate and the unemployment rate were real , inexcusable foot-in-mouth moments \u2014 and he \u2019 s been awkward and unprepared in a few responses .\nThe inability to get through what should have been a simple question on Thursday \u2014 the six priorities of his own national disability insurance scheme plan \u2014 was also inexcusable and can only be attributed to poor preparation and a confidence in \u201c winging it \u201d , seen by colleagues as a weakness in the way Albanese handles things .\nAlbanese can be excused for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there \u2019 s no excuse for not knowing enough to get through a question in a campaign media conference .\nThe Labor leader should have had enough of the basic detail in his mind to answer at least half of the question and then have enough rhetorical flourish at hand to get through the rest .\nIt \u2019 s what Morrison does .\nJohn Howard came out of his bruising time in the late 1980s convinced the way to beat Labor was to \u201c get up earlier and go to bed later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio stations before breakfast and checking in with all of the newspapers before bedtime .\nIt was his operating system in the lead up to the 1996 election and he made sure the mistakes he made in the 1985/88 period were not repeated .\nA landslide was his reward .\nThis is how Labor and Albanese will need to approach the last two weeks if they want to secure victory .\nAlso , he should wean himself off the props of having shadow ministers as backstops .\nIt has not served him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recalls the 1980 election campaign when Labor had Bill Hayden travel the country with ALP president ( and NSW rockstar ) Neville Wran and ACTU president Bob Hawke backing him up .\nThe comparison and contrast didn \u2019 t help at the end of a losing bid for power .\nAt the moment Albanese is metaphorically similar to the big theme behind Tennessee Williams \u2019 s Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , a world running out of lives .", "author": "Dennis Atkins", "url":

the 2019 campaign \u2014 two weeks before voters went to the polls \u2014 Clive Palmer decided to turn the blowtorch on Labor leader Bill Shorten .\n\u201c We thought that would be a disaster for Australia [ if Shorten won ] , \u201d Palmer told the ABC days after the election .\n\u201c So we decided to polarise the electorate and we thought we \u2019 d put what advertising we had left \u2026 into explaining to the people what Shorten \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they needed to be worried about them.\n\u201d Despite spending a record $ 84 million on that election campaign , Palmer \u2019 s United Australia Party didn \u2019 t win a single seat .\nBut many in Labor credit the billionaire mining magnate \u2019 s relentless anti-Shorten blitz in the final stretches as helping depress the party \u2019 s primary vote .\nThree years on , the only thing we can say with certainty about Palmer \u2019 s election plans is he still has a lot of money to burn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s promised to spend about $ 70 million during the campaign .\nThose messages , with the ubiquitous UAP yellow , are everywhere \u2014 from billboards littering highways to getting in the way of your YouTube binge .\nRecent data also shows where Palmer is outgunning the major parties .\nThe UAP has spent more than $ 2 million on general display advertising , totally dwarfing Labor and the Coalition .\nAnd on Google , there \u2019 s not even competition .\nSince 2020 , $ 15.5 million of the $ 18.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the UAP .\nThat could spell trouble for Labor .\nAlthough Palmer says he won \u2019 t preference the major parties ( telling the National Press Club last month he \u2019 d take the Greens over Labor or the Libs ) , his saturation of the airwaves could crowd out the opposition \u2019 s messaging .\nBut so far , Labor would be relieved he hasn \u2019 t gone into full-on attack mode against Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese \u2026 yet .\nInstead , the messaging from Palmer , and UAP leader Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place .\nPalmer is spruiking a harebrained idea to \u201c use the power of the Constitution \u201d to cap interest rates at 3 % , which has emerged as the UAP \u2019 s signature policy at this election .\nIn a rambling address to launch his party \u2019 s election campaign , Palmer talked about assets being sold to foreign buyers , the need to help more young Australians into the property market , and repaying the trillion dollars of Labor and Liberal debt through a minerals export licence .\nThere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , which sounds like something right out of the Greens .\nThe big takeaway from analysis of the UAP \u2019 s ads is that after spending most of 2021 spreading disinformation about vaccines , and attacking \u201c mandates \u201d , the party is trying to focus its attention on broader cost-of-living issues , while tapping into some of the latent dissatisfaction around lockdowns and the pandemic .\nA widely used recent ad is a case in point .\nIn it , a UAP candidate stares into a camera and recites the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nDomestic violence , one trillion dollars of debt , broken families , bankrupt businesses , depression , loneliness .\nNever let it happen again.\n\u201d In other words , a kind of vague pitch intended to draw in various types of disaffected people .\nSo far , both major parties are being targeted .\nIf anything , there \u2019 s been more criticism of Morrison , the incumbent .\nWill Palmer get anything out of his big ad blitz ?\nKelly , who should \u2019 ve run in the Senate , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house seat of Hughes .\nVarious opinion polls have put the UAP sitting at a steady 3-5 % primary vote .\nPalmer represents the party \u2019 s best chance at a spot in Parliament , fighting with Pauline Hanson , former Queensland Premier Campbell Newman ( Liberal Democrat ) and Coalition Senator Amanda Stoker for the roguest spot in the Senate .\nBut some Labor strategists worry the party could make inroads in outer suburban Melbourne seats like McEwen , Hawke and Dunkley , where voters ticked off at the city \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making its preferences crucial .\nSo far , Palmer remains unpredictable , fulfilling his role as Australian politics \u2019 chaos agent .\nWhile Australians largely ignored his attacks on vaccines , there are still plenty of undecided voters leaning away from the major parties .\nThere \u2019 s still no clear sense that vote is going to the UAP .\nUnless Palmer decides to do Morrison a huge solid , and hammer Albanese in the closing stages , his impact on this election could be minimal .", "author": "Kishor Napier-Raman", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/06/last-wildcard-will-clive-palmer-turn-cash-on-labor/",

campaign launch in Perth , which also showcased his team .\nOpposition treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers stepped up as the most prominent figure in the campaign after the leaders , garnering almost a quarter more coverage than his counterpart , Josh Frydenberg .\nThe Chalmers-Frydenberg debate this week played out in similar fashion to the Albanese-Morrison debate \u2014 that is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the participants refused to speak about the same issues .\nChalmers focused on Labor \u2019 s strong issues \u2014 the cost of living , waste and rorting of public funds , and wage

had Jason Clare receiving extensive coverage , as well as Richard Marles and Kristina Keneally ( Labor \u2019 s strong frontbench line-up , however , is inexplicably portrayed as a negative by some

make this election about something real", "content": "From the business breakfasts with their steaming bain-maries to the climate change forums in draughty church halls , something is happening in this country .\nIt has been happening right from the kick off , under the cover of the underpowered and then farcical campaign proper , with its stumbles turned into gaffes , and the mad prevarications of Morrison \u2014 \u201c It \u2019 s not about politics \u201d , the interest rates , Jesus \u2014 and now it is coming to the fore .\nIt \u2019 s a wave of determination that the election be about something real .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about a new multigroup alliance that \u2019 s pushing them .\nIt \u2019 s happening everywhere , and it may utterly sweep the Morrison government away , or be the means by which the Coalition somehow clings to power .\nThe three issues that are driving this groundswell campaign are climate change , integrity and corruption , and inequality as expressed in the cost of living and housing affordability and availability .\nThese three issues dominate almost exclusively , interlocking and reinforcing each other .\nOther matters \u2014 China , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 barely get a look in .\nIn these forums at least .\nWhich is to say , the forums with a left-right range , not the political spittoon where the crazed right dwell and propagate .\nFor the first time that I \u2019 ve seen , there is really no difference in what is being talked about , the questions coming , the sources of anger and insistence , in the chamber of commerce get-togethers and the touchy-feely blue-skivvie Uniting Church forums .\nAny Coalition MP foolish enough to turn up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get torn to shreds .\nDitto with corruption and integrity \u2014 Morrison \u2019 s absurd arabesques around the refusal to put forward a genuine federal ICAC simply will not fly .\nThat \u2019 s why last week , on Wednesday night , more than 30 Coalition candidates withdrew from candidate forums to be held over the following week , en masse and within a two-hour window ( according to a forum organiser , who compared notes with others ) .\nThese were forums Coalition candidates had already agreed to attend , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurious double bookings .\nThe reason ?\nNot that they were meeting opposition and ridicule on their absurd positions , but that they were getting no support at all .\nNone .\nThey had no party in the room , aside from whatever T-shirted dweebs they could bring along .\nWorse , the questions were coming in the form of demands for commitments \u2014 to vote up an ICAC , to cross the floor on climate .\nFinally , large groups of people were linking it all together .\nThey see the casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this government , as an expression of a mob that has lost the will to govern , or any sense of responsibility that comes with it .\nThus , they see its complementary expression in the net zero farce , in the fires response , in the flood response , and that in turn reflected in the cold indifference to the rising , searing effect of the nation dividing into two on the most basic possibilities of life and opportunity .\nIt feels like everything is on fire , and the bloke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t hold a hose .\nWhat \u2019 s happened ?\nThe simple picture is that the unity of the bourgeois class has collapsed .\nOne section of it \u2014 connected to old money , industries and rural communities ( or part of them ) \u2014 is holding firm , while a progressive group , aligned with newer sectors , has decisively broken loose .\nThey \u2019 ve joined with the hardcore section of the knowledge class and the separate organisation of green and teal movements has allowed for a unity of core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have felt dudded for decades \u2014 women , the health-afflicted , etc \u2014 have joined them , along with a separate group of \u201c rust \u201d independents with somewhat different social and other policy settings but the same core commitments .\nWhen this is combined with the core Labor vote , this new social recombination \u2014 which has only decisively occurred in this campaign , catalysed by Team Morrison \u2019 s failure of perception of it \u2014 then the numbers we \u2019 re starting to see ( 54 , 55 , now 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority they seek ( which , paradoxically , is not what the \u201c middle \u201d sector want ) .\nBut that \u2019 s only if there \u2019 s no countervailing power .\nThat \u2019 s a big if , because one of the features of the new social divide is that it separates not primarily on differing content values \u2014 though they \u2019 re there \u2014 but on the very act of participation itself .\nThis new super grouping are the ones that speak , have access to the means of speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ?\nThose not drawn to the crazy Pauline Hanson \u2019 s One Nation , United Australia Party , etc fringe ( about 10 % ) feel no one represents them , and has not for decades .\nThey have withdrawn into silence , as an act not of surrender but of resistance .\nThey resist debate , resist polling , resist talk .\nBut overwhelmingly they will go into the booth and vote for Scott Morrison , who most closely matches their resentment at being subordinated to those who do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a silent , emergent counter-power , then they may well be able to fight the progressive supergroup to an ugly draw , and the possibility of a Coalition plurality , giving them first nod at forming government .\nI hope not .\nI hope and believe that what I \u2019 m seeing and hearing in the streets and halls of the land is a determination to have the future start right now , and build it .\nBut don \u2019 t be surprised if the silent speak on May 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have \u2014 a refusal of consent to someone else \u2019 s vision \u2014 and we end up changed in everything but our government .", "author":

"Let \u2019 s start with Scott Morrison and the culture war .\nToday the prime minister once again defended Katherine Deves , his candidate for Warringah , after she called gender reassignment surgery \u201c mutilation \u201d .\nMorrison said he wouldn \u2019 t use the same language as Deves , but continues to stand by her .\nThe Liberal candidate came under fire during the early stages of the campaign after a series of now-deleted tweets attacking transgender people emerged .\nThey included false claims that half of trans men are sex offenders , and comparisons between anti-trans activism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deves has largely shied away from media ( despite Morrison \u2019 s claims she would not be \u201c cancelled \u201d ) , until she appeared on Sky News last night to walk back earlier apologies for calling trans people \u201c surgically mutilated and sterilised \u201d .\nFacing a grilling from reporters today , the PM claimed gender reversal surgery was \u201c a serious , significant issue \u201d for young adolescents , before being reminded the procedure isn \u2019 t available to minors in Australia .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not a surgeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , \u201d he said .\nAmid all that , Morrison managed to find another constituency to fall out with : barristers .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care if barristers and lawyers and others up there in Macquarie Street \u2014 not in the Parliament but in the barristers \u2019 chambers \u2014 disagree with me , \u201d he said , during one of his now frequent attacks on the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) .\n( Of course , real Sydney-heads know the barristers are mainly on Phillip St , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I digress ) .\nThat drew a swift rebuke from Australian Bar Association boss Matt Collins , who said he was deeply concerned by Morrison \u2019 s comments .\n\u201c Any person who has no truck with barristers can not have made a conscientious effort to understand their indispensable contribution to civic society , \u201d he said .\nOuch .\nMorrison was out in Bennelong today , once held by John Howard .\nWith popular local MP John Alexander retiring , Labor has grown increasingly optimistic about its chances of clawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the prime minister was NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet .\nIn a bit of symmetry , Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese campaigned with Victorian Premier Dan Andrews in Melbourne today .\nNeither state leader has featured much during their parties \u2019 respective federal campaigns , despite state premiers \u2019 unprecedented prominence during the past two years , and Perrottet and Andrews in particular essentially leading Australia through the latest phase of the pandemic .\nThere are a few political and strategic reasons for this .\nMorrison and Perrottet have famously clashed in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the NSW premier has criticised Morrison \u2019 s comments on the state \u2019 s ICAC and distanced himself from the PM \u2019 s comments on minority government .\nAnd at today \u2019 s press conference Perrottet refused to join the PM in attacking Labor \u2019 s housing equity scheme , saying he was \u201c open-minded \u201d about new policy .\nThe distance between Andrews , meanwhile , could be about avoiding what some Labor strategists worry is a rumble of \u201c anti-Dan \u201d sentiment , particularly in Melbourne \u2019 s outer suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic restrictions .\nCertainly the Liberals think that vote is out there for the taking , running attack billboards with Andrews and Albanese together , alongside the words \u201c Higher taxes .\nMandates .\nLockdowns \u201d .\nBut equally , both Perrottet and Andrews have their own elections to fight within the next 12 months , and might feel it best to have some clear air between their own brands and the current shitshow .\nIn other news , Alan Tudge has been found .\nThe cabinet minister-cum-backbencher ( somehow he \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood down in December following allegations he had an abusive relationship with former staffer Rachelle Miller , which he denies .\nTudge , who has essentially been in hiding during the campaign , was tracked down by a Sky News reporter in his safe seat of Aston .\nHe said he intended to return as education minister if the government is reelected .\n\u201c The prime

Australian Greens Leader Adam Bandt turned up in a group called \u201c Auspol shitposting \u201d .\nThe Facebook group comprising 3000 very online Australians is dedicated to discussing Australian politics ( \u201c auspol \u201d ) through the creation and sharing of ironically low-quality memes and posts ( \u201c shitposting \u201d ) .\nIt \u2019 s not a type of online space where politicians usually hang out \u2014 inauthentic , cringe-making social media posts from politicians are often the subject of lampooning by group members \u2014 which is why Bandt \u2019 s arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Members waited for him to post something , posting memes about his silent presence .\n( Unbeknown to them , Bandt \u2019 s participation was an accident .\nA Greens staffer had accidentally joined with the official account rather than their own . )\nIn response to a question about changing the group \u2019 s name for the election , Bandt responded : \u201c how about \u201c greems \u201d : ) \u201d .\nSince then , Easter eggs referencing the post have been sprinkled throughout the Greens \u2019 social media presence , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greems \u201d before editing it to the \u201c The Greens \u201d .\nThe official Greens website even has an official link \u2014 greens.org.au/greems \u2014 that goes to the Facebook group .\nThe Greems meme encapsulates the Australian Greens \u2019 improvisational approach to digital campaigning during this election .\nRather than a top-down strategy that sees every meme and shitpost run through layers of party bureaucracy , its digital team has been given the green light to create content that informs its audiences and drives conversation based around a few key messages .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Discord chat server where ideas for TikTok posts are brainstormed and study what \u2019 s made other videos successful .\nThe tone of the posts is different from the two major parties \u2019 online presence .\nIf the Liberal Party has perfected the \u201c boomer meme \u201d , the Greens have adopted the online posting vernacular and tenor of a younger generation : the Instagram feed looks more like the presence of a political influencer or community page , complete with online explainers and reposted popular content , mixed with what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nImportant to the strategy has been the organic collaboration with other online creators and communities .\nThe official Greens Facebook and Instagram pages have frequently been reposted with attribution content from pages like Australian Greens Memes for Actually Progressive Teens ( which is , according to the page \u2019 s bio , not run by Greens staff ) and the Simpsons against the Liberals .\nThese pages are treated almost like online constituencies , like an MP visiting a local club .\nThis two-way involvement creates a feedback loop : the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages will often in return share their content or ideas .\nAn example of this in practice is the \u201c if you recognise [ X ] then you will not be affected by the Greens plans to tax billionaires and corporations \u201d meme format .\nCreated by Australian Memes for Actually Progressive Teens , the format allowed people to remix and play with it \u2014 sharing nostalgic items that represent a middle- or lower-class upbringing in Australia \u2014 while also effectively communicating a major Greens policy .\nOne thing that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2019 Richard Di Natale didn \u2019 t even have a personal social media presence .\nBandt on the other hand seems more of a natural on social

TikTok meme ) .\nOther candidates have been allowed to shine too .\nStephen Bates earned plenty of media and social media attention for his campaign to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LGBT dating platform

campaigning was devoted to a real issue of wide relevance where there \u2019 s a genuine gulf between Labor and the Coalition .\nOn the one hand , Anthony Albanese supports pay rises for low-paid workers of 5.1 % , to ensure they don \u2019 t go backwards in real terms .\nOn the other , Scott Morrison thinks workers \u2019 real wages being maintained is \u201c economic vandalism \u201d and Albanese \u2019 s support shows he \u2019 s a \u201c loose unit \u201d on the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel on the fire of rising interest rates and rising cost of living \u201d , the prime minister says .\nMuch of the media appears to agree with Morrison \u2019 s \u201c we must cut low-paid workers \u2019 real wages \u201d position , so Albanese \u2019 s support has prompted much pearl-clutching and hyper-ventilation by the media .\nAlbanese was eager to embrace the issue this morning , and had his attack lines ready in the face of hostile questioning from journalists : What Scott Morrison says is that it is OK to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land that is worth $ 3 million .\nIt is OK his government can always find money for sports rorts , for commuter car park rorts , for all of this activity \u2026 he is OK to waste those billions of dollars .\nA billion dollars literally on advertising of the government itself .\nBut backing a $ 1-an-hour pay increase is not OK. Workers who are paid $ 20.33 an hour to be paid $ 1 extra .\nThat is what this debate is about .\nChallenged on whether he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad idea , Morrison professed it wasn \u2019 t his job even to offer an opinion .\nSome quotes from his media conference today .\nThe Fair Work Commission is the appropriate body to look at all of the economic implications for where they set the minimum wage .\nIf we wanted politicians to make this up , that is what we would have done \u2026 \u2026 not respecting the process of an independent setting of minimum wage conditions in this country \u2026 \u2026 what is calmly determined , sensibly , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these factors\u2026 But Albanese \u2019 s opinion , apparently , would lead to inflation and economic chaos .\nAt the same time , Morrison was arguing that wages were rising because \u201c businesses are growing and becoming stronger .\nThat is where pay rises come from.\n\u201d Confused about both the role of politicians , the Fair Work Commission and business in wage-fixing ?\nYou should be .\nThere \u2019 s at least an element of consistency in Morrison here and , for once , some laudable honesty in policy .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interests of business over the past decade , using several techniques : refusing to support minimum wage rises and cutting penalty rates ; increasing temporary migration to push wages down ; placing caps on public sector pay ; demonising unions ; and refusing to fund pay rises in service sectors run by private enterprise but funded by government ( like aged care \u2014 where Morrison is refusing to commit to funding the wage rise currently under consideration by the Fair Work Commission in its work value case for aged care workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for real wage cuts continues the Coalition \u2019 s policy over the previous three terms in office .\nIt \u2019 s saying the quiet part out loud : the Coalition supports businesses \u2019 relentless opposition to wage rises for workers , which have vanished in real wage terms since 2013 .\nIt will go down well with The Australian Financial Review , of course .\nBut whether it plays well in those crucial outer suburban and major regional seats that Morrison \u2014 mainly because he can \u2019 t go anywhere else \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a different matter .\nIn other news , Barnaby Joyce took a break from pork-barrelling to visit the National Press Club .\nThe challenge of stringing more than a handful of words together in relatively coherent fashion at one stage overcame the deputy prime minister , who suffered a nosebleed from the effort .\nHighlights \u2014 using the term loosely \u2014 included Joyce calling for a domestic shipping industry ( something urged by Labor , while several Coalition governments have \u2014 quite rightly \u2014 worked to kill it as the protectionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Help to Buy policy \u201c Fidel Castro politics \u201d ( continuing his Cuba obsession , after branding the Solomon Islands the Pacific equivalent two weeks ago ) , and his argument that the rest of the world was backing away from their climate commitments .", "author": "Bernard Keane", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/11/campaign-morrison-stakes-reelection-bid-on-cutting-wages/", "published": "Wed, 11 May 2022 05:56:51 +0000", "published_utc": 1652263011, "collection_utc": 1652264366}, {"id": "crikey--2022-05-11--How does Albanese\u2019s wages plan impact jobs, inflation and poverty?

@ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s starting to feel over .\nThough it will get interesting , a week of dirt-sheets and stunts , an ultra-late Liberal campaign launch , and then three or four days waiting for the 72-hour surprise , the stunningly lying gotcha , the hoax , dropped too late to reply to .\nWith a dozen or more viable independent candidates , such surprises may be going off everywhere .\nAre the teal candidates ready for how dirty , brutal and sudden this could get ?\nSo in the interim let \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats are at .\nApplying , to a degree , your correspondent \u2019 s argument that the political division now lies between those speaking , and those largely \u2014 between an expanded progressive-liberal grouping on one side voting Labor-Green-teal , middle \u201c quiet \u201d Australians voting Coalition , \u201c silent \u201d Australians \u2014 who now feel so excluded that silence , withdrawal , constitutes resistance .\nThey vote Coalition , Labor and right fringe ( PHON , UAP , Lib Dem , etc ) .\nThere \u2019 s a final group of vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose visibility gives the impression of the hard right being smaller than it is .\nWith that in mind , with the caveats that this assessment doesn \u2019 t factor in every psephological detail , that this is a more pessimistic reading , that this is the application of a 53-47 two-party preferred as a non-uniform way , here \u2019 s an assessment which is based in large part on being in or around most of these marginals over the past month .\nAnd really for no other reason than one passes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words : reassurance , reassurance , reassurance .\nWorking our way through the different sets , and using an electoral calculator we get the following .\nBoothby : on a 1.4 % margin , a liberal middle-class seat in Adelaide Hills , with a retiring local member and anti-sexual abuse campaigner Jo Dyer as an independent without sufficient grunt to win the seat herself , this must be a Labor gain .\nHiggins : the seat so teal , its teal is the Greens .\nWith Liberal Katie Allen on 2.3 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes of liberal disgust , plus demographic change , blue rinse mortality or more disgust to swing to Labor ?\nPossibly just out of reach for Greens .\nBass : there are 500 votes in it .\nCost of living , housing , etc , rather than climate change or corruption will do it for Labor if it does .\nLiberal Bridget Archer \u2019 s only chance of survival is that she \u2019 s pulled the deuce : managed to look like a darkish teal independent on the basis of a few dissident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the campaign .\nJacqui Lambie \u2019 s preferences will help , but how much ?\nChisholm : about the same margin .\nIf Labor takes it , it will be because conflicting politics within the large Chinese-Australian community cancel each other out , solidarity with sitting Liberal MP Gladys Liu being pushed against by community dismay with Coalition sabre-rattling .\nAnd a lot more .\nSwan : Labor needs a 3.2 % swing .\nWith premiums from the incumbent Liberal retiring , and being a West Australian seat , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Labor challenger ex-muso Chris Lynch was recently smeared with an ancient conviction for holding speed , which may actually help him in this NW Tasmanian seat .\nLikely gain , but here the \u201c silent \u201d faction , and a dose of culture war sentiment , may hold it for the Coalition .\nReid : on 3.2 % it should go .\nOne reason it may not is the culture war over trans being stirred up around Katherine Deves \u2019 comments , and directed at this seat \u2019 s ( and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are six seats needing a 4-5 % swing and Longman on 3.3 % , jumping into 4 % with the Queensland Labor anti-premium , if that is still operative .\nThree of the other seats are Queensland , pushing them to the 5 % swing required end .\nThe only very likely Labor gain in this area would appear to be : Casey , outer-urban Melbourne , retiring respected Liberal ( Tony Smith ) , demographic shift ( progressives going outer ) .\nBrisbane is a stretch on 4.9 % , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greens candidate , Labor may pull clear of them but benefit from the Queensland Greens \u2019 huge ground campaign .\nDickson , in the ex-urban hills .\nWill it spit out Peter Dutton in disgust ?\nSadly Ali France hasn \u2019 t been an impressive Labor candidate .\nRobertson , on the NSW coast north of Sydney , is a bellwether , so will go with any consistent swing .\nLeichhardt , north Queensland , is on 4.2 % , has the Queensland anti-premium , and the hero status of Warren Entsch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\nTwo eastern suburban Melbourne seats \u2014 Deakin and LaTrobe \u2014 will go if a swing is on .\nLet \u2019 s split the difference .\nWest Australian premium : Pearce on 5.4 % , Hasluck on 5.9 % .\nPearce , with scandal-tainted retiring member ( Christian Porter ) and the WA premium , must go .\nHasluck , with Ken Wyatt , probably won \u2019 t .\nAfter that , with a 6 % + swing required , it gets tough for Labor , while teal opportunities start to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Sydney , on 6.9 % ( retiring , respected member John Alexander , pissed-off Chinese community ) , and Ryan in outer Brisbane with strong Labor and Green candidates , and demographic shift .\nSturt , also on 6.9 % has a felicitous ballot draw \u2014 Greens , Labor , top ; Liberals last \u2014 which would help .\nBeyond that , the best hope for an outlier would be Tangney , with the WA premium needing a 9.5 % swing .\nThere are four Queensland seats in the 7 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a real swing obliterates the Queensland Labor deficit , presuming it still exists .\nIn sum : Labor 10-13 seats , taking them , without Labor losses , to 79-82 , Coalition to 65-67 ( presuming , from here on , that the Liberals take back Hughes ) .\nThe Greens have real chances in three Labor seats : Griffith ( inner Brisbane ) , Richmond ( northern NSW coast ) and McNamara ( old Melbourne Ports ) , and leaving aside some wilder hopes .\nIn Griffith and Richmond , high-profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the 4000-5000 votes they need from Labor to get into second place and surge to victory .\nThe NSW collapse : some in NSW are pessimistic , arguing that various seats could go : Hunter ( coal , retiring member , celeb drop-in ) , Parramatta ( parachuted in candidate , pissed-off local communities ) , Macquarie ( 0.2 % margin Sydney edge , Blue Mountains , embourgeoisment ) , and Gilmore ( I forget ) .\nThe Victoria boondoggle : the possibilities of a crossover are Corangamite ( 1.1 % , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , ditto McEwan ( same , although on a 5.3 % swing , tough ) .\nOthers : Lingiari on 5.5 % ( non-Darwin NT ) ?\nLyons ( central Tasmania ) ditto ?\nBoth seem unlikely .\nIn Lingiari , retiring Labor member from Alice Springs , Warren Snowden , is being replaced by former territory pollie and Tiwi woman Marion Scrymgour at a time of usual NT hijinks , premier resigning , high crime .\nOn this reckoning , say three to four total , Labor \u2019 s tally goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Libs 68-70 , Greens 2-3 .\nNow presume for a second that no new teals won .\nBob Katter remains the only total pro-Coalition independent .\nIf new teals win in Kooyong and Goldstein , with possibilities in North Sydney , Wentworth and Mackellar , and \u201c rust \u201d independent Rob Priestly in Nicholls ( northern Victoria ) , then assume three Coalition losses to 65-68 .\nIf the Libs make no gains from Labor , and teals and rusts come through , then the overall array of forces would be around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greens , 4-6 teals and rusts , plus Wilkie , and Rebekha Sharkie ) , and 60-65 on the right , a two-thirds/one-third split .\nHow does it hang , or not ?\nThe scenarios On an overall 3.5 % swing , yielding a 52-48 2PP with , say , three losses , Labor needs about half a dozen seats to swing well outside the average \u2014 most in the 5 % -7 % range , and a couple in the 7 % -11 % range .\nIt would take a 5 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn that , winning say 12 of 15 Liberal seats requiring a 5 % swing or less , gaining five outliers , and taking two to three reverse losses , Labor climbs into the 80+ seats range .\nLabor wins only Boothby , Chisholm , one of Bass or Braddon , Casey , Longman , Swan and Pearce , for a net gain of seven .\nIt loses one of Griffith or Richmond to the Greens , and one or both Macquarie and Corangamite to the Libs , for loss of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats .\nThe Coalition loses two to three of Goldstein , Kooyong , North Sydney , Wentworth , Mackellar and Nicholls to teals/rusts .\nLabor does not win , say , Casey and Longman , loses four total to Greens and Libs to come out at 70 seats .\nThe Coalition loses six seats to independents and Greens , regains Hughes , comes out at 71 .\nThe 11-member crossbench would then be , right to left : Katter , Sharkie , Priestly , Allegra Spender , Zali Steggall , Zoe Daniel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two Greens .\nWith that slight edge , or with a major party tie , or even with one or two less seats than Labor , the Morrison Coalition should then get the nod to form a government .\nLabor would have to do what it has said it wouldn \u2019 t and make a stronger and more public coalition arrangement .\nOr stay in opposition and wait for the government to fall .\nOr power on into

consideration is due to the shape of the new Parliament and what it might mean for the legislative agenda of an Albanese government .\nMost of the attention in this respect has focused on the prospect of a hung parliament , and while this is understandable up to a point , it overlooks the all-but-equal power of a Senate that Labor will assuredly not control even in the event of an extravagant landslide win .\nThe mechanics of the Senate electoral system are bewildering to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handle on by boiling the contest down to left-versus-right , with Labor and the Greens in the red corner and the Coalition , One Nation and potentially the United Australia Party in the blue .\nWith each state electing six senators at a normal half-Senate election , the typical result involves an even division between the two , with the Greens commonly taking one of the three left seats and one populist or another sometimes doing so on the right .\nWhat can fundamentally change the Senate balance is if a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMaintaining the left-versus-right simplification , this can be understood using the two-party-preferred concept familiar from the lower house .\nA fair chance of a four-and-two result arises if either the Coalition or Labor wins the two-party preferred by more than 57-43 , since a half-Senate election quota is one-seventh and four-sevenths equals roughly 57 % .\nSuch was the case in Queensland in 2019 , when the Coalition won 58.4 % of the two-party-preferred in the House of Representatives and the Senate result duly delivered three seats to the Coalition plus one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one and the second left seat going to the Greens .\nSince the senators elected in 2019 are not up for reelection , the legacy of that result means the left needs to do better than parity in one state or territory if Labor and the Greens are to account for half the Senate numbers , and two if they are to achieve the actual majority needed to pass legislation .\nIn this respect at least , the polls don \u2019 t look that promising for Labor , since trend measures don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 % threshold in any mainland state ( leaving aside Roy Morgan \u2019 s implausible state breakdowns , and excepting Tasmania where little data is available ) .\nHowever , the momentum behind teal-ish independent David Pocock does raise the prospect of an unprecedented result in the Australian Capital Territory in which its two seats both go to a broadly defined left at the expense of arch-conservative Liberal Senator Zed Seselja .\nIt \u2019 s at this point of the analysis that the left-right oversimplification can no longer be sustained , as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily categorised : Jacqui Lambie and Nick Xenophon .\nLambie reduced Tasmania \u2019 s Liberals to two in winning her seat in 2019 , such that she already redresses the Queensland imbalance if we take the view of her expressed here recently by Guy Rundle that \u201c the thing has become its opposite \u201d .\nSuch is Lambie \u2019 s star quality that there seems a strong chance of a repeat result delivering a second seat to the Jacqui Lambie Network via its Tasmanian lead candidate , Tammy Tyrrell .\nSimilarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Australia could well reduce the Liberals to two seats there , leaving two for Labor and one for the Greens .\nSo while a Labor-Greens majority looks unlikely , there are three pathways to a result that would allow an incoming Labor government to negotiate with centrist crossbenchers .\nBy the same token , each is uncertain in its own right :

night has Labor on track to win 80 seats .\n\u201c The election is in the hands of the Australian people .\nIt \u2019 s not in the hands of pollsters or modellers , \u201d Prime Minister Scott Morrison said today .\nBut one of Morrison \u2019 s final chances to reverse that trend \u2014 the third leaders debate last night \u2014 passed by without race-shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a typically eye-opening Niki Savva hit revealed the campaign for Katherine Deves \u2014 the alienating , train-wreck candidate for Warringah , tainted by her transphobic comments \u2014 was being run out of the Prime Minister \u2019 s Office .\nIt confirms suspicions that Deves exists as a kind of culture war dogwhistle to socially conservative voters in Labor \u2019 s suburban Red Wall .\nBut that strategy , along with growing momentum around teal independents , has coalesced into an existential threat for Liberal moderates , worried about their own future in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right no matter who forms government next week .\nToday , NSW Treasurer Matt Kean , the wettest of Liberal wets , warned that the teal wave could purge the party of moderates and drag it towards crazy land , currently inhabited by the US Republican Party .\nTony Abbott , meanwhile , urged Warringah Liberals fleeing the sinking ship to fight in other seats to stay and back Deves .\nThe anti-trans stuff resurfaced today when Morrison , alongside Bass MP Bridget Archer , was announcing a $ 55 million mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An emotional Archer spoke with rare honesty about her own struggles with mental health issues .\nBut she then faced a series of questions about the struggles of transgender people , in light of Deves \u2019 comments .\n\u201c We can all do better , \u201d was the key line in Archer \u2019 s response .\nThe MP was one of five who crossed the floor in February to provide greater protections for LGBTIQA+ students during debate over the government \u2019 s contentious religious freedom legislation .\nThat sense of independence may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights to keep the ultra-marginal seat .\nIt was Morrison \u2019 s third trip to Bass this campaign .\nSo far this week , he \u2019 s also been in Liberal-held Bennelong , Robertson and Reid , a sign his campaign could be on an increasingly defensive footing in the final stretch .\nSpeaking of Reid , controversy around Liberal MP Fiona Martin continued for a second day .\nAt a debate on 2GB yesterday , Martin appeared to confuse her opponent , Labor \u2019 s Sally Sitou , with another Asian-Australian woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former \u201c couldn \u2019 t run in Fowler \u201d .\nIt was Le who lost Fowler to Kristina Keneally and the Labor machine , not Sitou .\nThe Labor candidate demanded an apology , but Martin has continued to double down , pointing to old reports Sitou was considering running in Cabramatta ( not Fowler ) .\n\u201c I am the granddaughter of Greek migrants , \u201d Martin said in a follow-up post today .\n\u201c My record makes clear I would never direct a racial slur at anyone .\nThere is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be called out.\n\u201d Earlier , Morrison backed his MP , claiming it \u201c wasn \u2019 t the case \u201d Martin had confused Sitou and Le .\nWatch the video and judge for yourself .\nFor the Morrison camp , it \u2019 s another unwelcome gaffe in a key marginal seat .\nThere

Nockles running in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kovacic , running in Parramatta as \u201c the real Eel \u201d , doesn \u2019 t really live in Western Sydney .\nNo wonder Anthony Albanese had a spring in his step today , another worrying sign for Morrison .\nThe opposition leader was in Flynn ( LNP +8.7 % ) , a regional Queensland seat higher up the electoral totem poll , where he made an announcement on battery manufacturing .\nSpeaking in front of whirring machinery that at times drowned out questions , Albanese looked as in control of the press pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign .\nAnother worry for a

bulletins there are images of the leader doing something positive .\nThere \u2019 s a longstanding belief that if you couple positive images with positive analysis and reportage , you \u2019 ll win the day .\nWin enough days , you win the campaign .\nAnd winning the campaign can be enough to overcome a polling gap that existed before the campaign started .\n2019 was a classic case , and showed Scott Morrison was a master of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same strategy .\nEvery day he \u2019 s making some minor announcement \u2014 often a new handout \u2014 and then being filmed in situ .\nThe role of hi-vis vests and helmets in campaigns has long been mocked , but Morrison is undeterred , and happily cosplays for the cameras wherever he goes .\nMock if you like , but it \u2019 s about the images , about the small number of disengaged and undecided/uninterested voters who pay no attention to politics but might catch a glimpse of a politician on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , is the chance to convey a positive or negative image .\nBut as colleague Cam Wilson has pointed out , it seems that the more Morrison gets about generating those images , the less voters like him .\nAll polls show the Coalition \u2019 s vote , and Morrison \u2019 s net approval rating , falling during the campaign after a brief rise at the start following Albanese \u2019 s first-day gaffe .\nAnd female voters look to be deeply hostile to Morrison .\nAs The Australian Financial Review \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ipsos poll , Morrison \u2019 s numbers among female voters are dire and not shifting .\nLabor \u2019 s primary vote lead among women is eight , compared with five among men .\nHis net disapproval is 23 among women and 16 among men .\nAlbanese \u2019 s lead as preferred prime minister is seven among women and he has led among women throughout the campaign .\nMen have tilted Albanese \u2019 s way only in the latest poll , 41-38 .\nWhen did the collapse in female support for Morrison happen ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ It tracks male and female two-party-preferred outcomes .\nBoth male and female support for Labor pulled away dramatically from support for the Coalition in 2021 \u2014 but at different dates .\nMale support suddenly shifted in November-December , and began a steep trajectory of rising support for the ALP .\nThat coincides with the period when the government \u2019 s failure to secure rapid antigen tests , and the inability of people to find any , was dominating the news .\nBut women turned towards Labor much earlier in the Roy Morgan data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged to reveal her ordeal and treatment by the government .\nAt that exact point , female voters \u2014 who were about evenly split on the parties over the pandemic \u2014 shifted to Labor , and it only got worse after that .\nMorrison \u2019 s comprehensive bungling of the Higgins matter \u2014 will we ever find out who in his office was briefing against her partner , or will that inquiry vanish with Phil Gaetjens ?\n\u2014 and the astonishing failure of both he and Christian Porter to properly deal with historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which Porter denies ) drove female voters en masse from the Coalition .\nThe reemergence of the alleged disgusting treatment of Rachelle Miller during the campaign \u2014 with Morrison confirming the invisible Alan Tudge would return as education minister after the election despite an alleged huge payout to Miller \u2014 will only serve to reinforce the view that Morrison has a profoundly troubling view of women and their right to workplace safety .\nThe gap in the Morgan poll is still stark despite some narrowing during the campaign : Labor leads by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , compared with just two points among men .\nThe long campaign Morrison planned was designed to run down Labor \u2019 s lead so he could exploit his alleged campaigning genius .\nBut he appears to have only confirmed to half the electorate what they worked out more than a year ago .",

@ @ @ @ .\nIf you were giving the Alan Tudge story a review on Goodreads the key points would be : interesting , but way too many plot holes .\nSo what is the story of Tudge ?\nHere \u2019 s a quick explainer .\nIn November 2020 , Tudge \u2019 s former staffer Rachelle Miller revealed that she and Tudge had conducted a secret affair while she worked for him .\nTudge publicly admitted to the affair and apologised to his family .\nThen in December 2021 , Miller lodged formal allegations that Tudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consensual affair .\nTudge denies the allegations .\nMorrison announced an independent investigation into the allegations , and Tudge stepped aside from the ministry .\nStuart Robert , minister for aged care , picked up his portfolio while Tudge was on personal leave .\nMichael Bradley gives a very good wrap-up here of what we know about this case .\nAt last night \u2019 s leaders \u2019 debate , Morrison said of the issue : \u201c We had an independent inquiry .\nWe dealt with the matter.\n\u201d The independent inquiry found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards .\nDespite finding apparently no evidence of wrongdoing , Tudge remained on the backbench .\nWeird .\nFurther , Miller didn \u2019 t participate in the inquiry , as she claimed the government had ignored her concerns over its terms of reference and she thought the investigation \u201c smacks of a political fix \u201d .\nLast night , debate host Mark Riley asked Morrison a seemingly straightforward question : \u201c Don \u2019 t taxpayers have the right to know why they \u2019 ve paid half a million dollars in compensation to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary and former lover , if he apparently did nothing wrong ?\n\u201d Morrison answered : \u201c This matter , I \u2019 m advised , has not even been settled.\n\u201d News.com.au reported in early April that Miller was set to receive a taxpayer-funded compensation payment of at least $ 500,000 , plus legal costs .\nThis was later confirmed by Guardian Australia .\nThen later that week , Coalition campaign spokeswoman Anne Ruston said on ABC \u2019 s Radio National the payout was not related to the misconduct allegations raised by Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last night Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese called for a little bit of transparency , please , around why taxpayers are forking over a tidy $ 500,000 .\nMorrison replied that it was a matter of a personal nature \u2014 but Miller has released Morrison and the Commonwealth of confidentiality obligations towards her \u2014 meaning the government is free to share all information .\nWith Tudge moving himself to the backbench just a few months out from an election , it was assumed that he would just slowly disappear into the night .\nIndeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made people think this when he said in early March : \u201c Today [ Tudge ] has informed me that in the interests of his family and his own well-being and in order to focus on his reelection as the member for Aston he is not seeking to return to the frontbench , and I support his decision.\n\u201d However .\nIn the very first week of the election campaign , Morrison surprised everyone by saying Tudge was \u201c technically \u201d still a member of his cabinet , and that he hoped he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition was reelected .\nHe confirmed this again last night , saying that Tudge still had a \u201c warrant as a minister \u201d .\n\u201c He has not resigned as a minister , nor has he been dismissed , \u201d Morrison said .\n\u201c He will be happy to come back and serve in the ministry , and I welcome that.\n\u201d And by the way , where is Tudge ?\nTo put a cherry on top of the mystery Tudge sundae , he has rarely been sighted .\nIn fact , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trending on Twitter .\nRumour has it our own correspondent-at-large Guy Rundle was trying to track him down but to no avail .\nIt was Sky News that found him , campaigning in his Melbourne electorate .\nWhen asked about the payout to Miller , Tudge said : \u201c As the prime minister said , he \u2019 s unaware and I \u2019 m unaware .\nIt \u2019 s a matter for the Department of Finance.\n\u201d So neither the PM nor the minister/not minister at the centre of the case have any idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500,000 payout \u2014 it \u2019 s just a finance thing .\nTudge was sure of one thing though , telling Sky News : \u201c The prime

governments out the door ?\nOr is it like 2010 or 2016 when troubled , divided governments clung to minority status ?\nToday \u2019 s offering in the \u201c which election was that ?\n\u201d game was Morrison declaring that he would change his style and political personality after the election , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , it is painfully clear , the Liberal Party \u2019 s campaign focus groups must be showing are top of mind for voters .\nAsked about his poor relationship with voters today , Morrison offered a departure from the previous \u201c I \u2019 m like a dentist , you may not like me but you need me \u201d rhetoric .\nInstead , we got : You know , over the last three years and particularly the last two what Australians have needed from me going through this pandemic has been strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn \u2019 t enabled Australians to see a lot of other gears in the way I work .\nAnd I know Australians know that I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues and

change with the way I do things .\nWhich immediately brings to mind Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 2010 campaign .\nAfter Kevin Rudd blew up that campaign by leaking against Gillard , ending her thumping poll lead over Tony Abbott , Gillard \u2019 s campaign team looked for ways to reset , and settled on an interview with then-Fairfax journalists promising that voters would now see \u201c the real Julia \u201d .\nThe immediate problem , apparently unanticipated by Labor , was the question \u201c real Julia \u201d prompted \u2014 had she been \u201c fake Julia \u201d all this time , and had only decided to unmask herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose the election ?\nIt went down like a lead zeppelin in a campaign that left neither side with a majority .\n\u201c Real Julia \u201d was never mentioned by Labor again \u2014 but the Liberals sure didn \u2019 t forget it .\nMorrison , at least , isn \u2019 t offering \u201c real ScoMo \u201d .\nHe \u2019 s saying the real ScoMo is obviously a problem and instead voters will get \u201c New , Improved ScoMo \u201d .\nA \u201c kinder , gentler ScoMo \u201d , perhaps .\nBut only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday we \u2019 ll get the business-as-usual , aggressive , dog-whistling , divisive , lying ScoMo .\nWhat \u2019 s fascinating about the change of tack is that it comes so late in the campaign , and comes many months after it became apparent that female voters have a major problem with Morrison .\nHas the diagnosis within the Liberal campaign team changed , and they \u2019 ve only now woken up to the threat Morrison himself poses to the reelection of the government ?\nDid Wednesday night \u2019 s debate , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters , prompt a rethink about why Morrison is alienating so many voters ?\nOr is this merely a different solution to a problem they \u2019 ve known for a long time , but initially decided to address via the \u201c you may not like me but you respect me \u201d line ?\nWe may find out after the election .\nThe tradition in Australian politics is that , after the election , the respective campaign directors address the National Press Club about their campaigns and what worked and what didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d will undoubtedly be a question directed at Liberal director Andrew Hirst \u2014 who masterminded the surprise 2019 win and , who knows , might yet pull off another miracle with \u201c new ScoMo \u201d .\nBut as with \u201c real Julia \u201d , you can bet the opposition will have a field day with it .\nEspecially the bulldozer bit \u2014 it didn \u2019 t take Albanese very long to home in on that .\n\u201c A bulldozer wrecks things .\nA bulldozer knocks things over .\nI \u2019 m a builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison \u2019 s statement .\nAnd then the kicker :

Here\u2019s how the PM can still win the election", "content": "Scott Morrison \u2019 s miracle election win in 2019 still overshadows this campaign .\nFor starters , it means nobody is willing to write off the prime minister , even as the poll numbers get worse , the Coalition fails to land a clear blow on Anthony Albanese , and the debate coalesces around issues and talking points favourable to Labor .\nBut Morrison remains a true believer in his ability to prove the polls wrong\u2026 again .\nThe path to victory has become a tightrope , but it \u2019 s still there .\nLiberals believe a chunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shift in the final week , and that the undecideds will stay with the devil they know .\nMorrison \u2019 s strategy for the next week is twofold .\nFirstly , the campaign will continue to double-down on relentlessly negative messaging , trying to paint Albanese as weak , inconsistent and out of his depth on the economy and national security .\nWhat \u2019 s notable is just how much more negative the Liberal messaging has become through the campaign .\nMorrison \u2019 s opening salvo was still peppered with post-COVID optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the rest of the world .\nThrough late April , Liberal ads on Facebook still spruiked Australia \u2019 s economic recovery and our comparatively low unemployment numbers .\nBut historically high inflation figures and an interest rate rise dented the government \u2019 s ability to rest on the laurels of economic management , and gave Labor an easy attack in one of the Coalition \u2019 s traditionally strong areas .\nSince then , the attack ads online have been uniformly negative , as has Morrison \u2019 s messaging , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor , a tactic that runs up against the opposition \u2019 s small target stonewall .\nThe second prong of this strategy is a highly targeted \u2014 and slightly hopeful \u2014 campaign map .\nThat relies on a fizzing of the teal wave in urban seats ( where Morrison is too toxic to travel ) , with Liberal losses limited to one or two at absolute most .\nNext , it \u2019 s about limiting some of the projected Labor gains .\nThis week , Morrison \u2019 s been on a defensive footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reid , Robertson and Chisholm .\nIt needs to hold most of those seats .\nThe government is also optimistic about retaining its dominance in Queensland and losing no ground ( although that won \u2019 t guarantee them victory ) .\nFinally , Morrison needs his \u201c suburban strategy \u201d to make gains in Labor territory .\nHe \u2019 s been a regular visitor in Parramatta , which ranks high on the target list , as well as Gilmore on the NSW South Coast and Corangamite in Victoria .\nOther \u201c under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Northern Territory , the Tasmanian seat of Lyons , and possibly McEwen in Melbourne \u2019 s outer suburbs .\nAmid all that seat flipping , the Coalition could probably cling on to power with just 74 seats .\nCentre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie , a former Liberal , has indicated she \u2019 d negotiate with the Liberals first in the event of a hung Parliament , while recognising that her electorate of Mayo had never been a Labor seat .\nBob Katter is Bob Katter .\nBut he went with Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would only require a commitment to build the Mother of All Dams somewhere near Mount Isa to get on board .\nThe path is narrow and uncertain , but it \u2019 s still very much there .\nBut if Morrison remains prime minister after May 21 , it would be a miracle to dwarf the miracle of 2019 .\nThat election shattered so many presumptions about how governments win , proving a rookie PM , barely holding together a bitterly divided , policy-lite government , could turn things around on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Morrison is a widely disliked leader too unpopular to campaign in much of the country , running an even more divided , policy-barren government , grappling with big economic shocks and a major national security fail in the middle of the campaign .\nMaybe we \u2019 d chalk a repeat miracle down to Morrison \u2019 s formidable campaign genius , which seems to basically boil down to his ability to nail attack lines on cue and look energetic for the nightly news .\nMaybe such a victory would be in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reflection of a latent conservatism and fear hidden too deep in the electorate for pollsters and strategists to find .\nIf Morrison does win again , we \u2019 ll no doubt be spending another three years trying to work out how .", "author": "Kishor Napier-Raman", "url":

gaffes and petty personality attacks , Scott Morrison has decided he wants to have a debate on policy .\nThe Coalition \u2019 s \u201c signature \u201d housing policy , unveiled at yesterday \u2019 s campaign launch , is a thought bubble about letting people unlock superannuation savings to buy their first home .\nIt \u2019 s also an idea we \u2019 ve seen plenty of current and former Liberals \u2014 such as John Howard , Malcolm Turnbull , Mathias Cormann and Peter Dutton \u2014 dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s policy would inflate an already overheated housing market ( \u201c like kerosene on a bonfire \u201d was the line from campaign spokesman Jason Clare yesterday ) .\nThis morning , the government \u2019 s Superannuation Minister Jane Hume conceded prices would , in fact , go up .\nAt a press conference this morning , Morrison repeatedly ignored questions asking whether he would release any potential modelling underpinning the policy .\nWhen asked if he could point to any experts backing the scheme , in light of the sharp criticism from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Property Council .\nYou \u2019 ve almost got to admire the brazenness .\nFor five weeks there \u2019 s been a gnawing frustration in the community , especially among younger Australians , about the perceived indifference to skyrocketing housing prices from both major parties .\nMorrison \u2019 s slightly more positive tone of recent days seems like a calculated response to a feeling among many voters that he \u2019 s too negative and unpleasant , and the housing issue feels designed to create the fa\u00e7ade of a fourth-term agenda \u2014 and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few young people who might still consider voting for the Coalition .\nIt \u2019 s also peak Morrison because it can be distilled into a cheap , palatable message ( \u201c Housing good , Big Super bad !\n\u201d ) \u201c Am I going to agree with those who want to stand up , stand with the big union super funds ?\nI \u2019 m going to stand with the home buyer .\nThat \u2019 s who I \u2019 m standing with , \u201d the prime minister said today .\nHe also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at today \u2019 s presser , Sam Biggins , LNP candidate for the Queensland marginal seat of Blair , could sing the praises of the policy because he comes from the real estate industry .\nI mean look at him .\nStill , the super housing announcement gives Anthony Albanese actual policy to grapple with in the final days of the campaign .\nSo far , Labor has been more than happy to chip away at Morrison \u2019 s personality , a tactic that seems to be working .\nAlbanese was out campaigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , in his quest to win two , maybe three seats in the state .\nA recent poll published in The West Australian showed while Labor is still tipped to win the key seats of Swan and Pearce , things have tightened in the west .\nLabor hope McGowan \u2019 s absurd dominance at a state level could give the party a much-needed boost , so it was unsurprising to see the premier front the presser , as the two announced more funding for a hospital in Perth .\nAlbanese faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 whether he \u2019 d increase the deficit , and when Labor would release all its policy costings ( in 2013 , Tony Abbott famously left this until two days out from the election ) .\nBut every day that Albanese doesn \u2019 t have some kind of major implosion , or which passes by without some big , momentum-shifting incident , is another good one for the opposition .\nThe Liberals hope the housing fight could do that for them .\nSoon we \u2019 ll know .\nBefore we wrap up today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clowns over at Advance Australia .\nToday , the Australian Electoral Commission ruled the far-right lobby group \u2019 s signs depicting ACT Senate candidate David Pocock and Warringah MP Zali Steggall , both independents , as Greens breached electoral laws .\nPocock says he \u2019 ll seek prosecution of Advance over the ads .\nIt \u2019 s

"\u2018What chance is there of a fair election in Queensland against the combined influence of Murdoch and Palmer?\u2019", "content": "This is an edited transcript of a speech made by journalist Kerry O \u2019 Brien to a campaign event hosted by the ABC Friends and ABC Alumni in Sydney yesterday .\nI have not seen an Australia so bereft of trust in its politicians , so cynical of their motives and their promises as it is today .\nAnd I have not seen an Australia before whose cherished public broadcaster has been so devalued and subjected to such sustained attack from those who would seek to neuter it , or worse , destroy it .\nAnd yet , in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been more important in my lifetime .\nIn my years as a correspondent in the United States I regularly used to visit American TV stations across the nation to edit and transmit my stories back to Australia .\nThe comparison of resources and infrastructure between the commercial stations I visited and the public broadcaster , PBS , was like a contrast between the first world and the third .\nPBS was and is , with rare exceptions like NPR , the poor relation of American media .\nAnd the American commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 ve often wondered , as I \u2018 ve watched America \u2014 the world \u2019 s once-great bastion of democracy \u2014 lurch further and further away from the spirit of its constitution , and further down the treacherous road of greater inequity and division towards authoritarianism , how different America \u2019 s story might be today if it had had a strong public broadcasting culture to reflect and enhance and inspire its beating heart .\nIn Australia we would be fools not to see the fraying edges of our own democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same seeds being sewn and to see some of the naked self-interest put on display to promote powerful vested interests against the interests of the nation .\nTo me , it is reasonable conjecture that when Clive Palmer , a single individual who made a fortune from fossil fuel , spends a massively obscene amount of money in this election campaign \u2014 as he did in the last \u2014 he is looking to orchestrate an outcome that will facilitate his efforts to maintain and build his fortune further from fossil fuel .\nRegardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single individual could influence the outcome of a national election by sheer weight of money , is fundamentally anti-democratic .\nAnd when two former prime ministers acknowledge publicly that , in government , they lived in fear of the power and muscle of another individual \u2014 Rupert Murdoch \u2014 and when the organs of that individual have the scope to shut down or subvert valid and important public debate , we should also recognise that level of media ownership and that kind of power as fundamentally anti-democratic , as a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , what chance is there of a fair election in Queensland against the combined influence of two men , Rupert Murdoch and Clive Palmer .\nAnd as the realities of the digital age have drawn the ABC and News Corp more and more into direct competition , with the ABC embracing online news programming , applying exactly the same logic that saw it expand beyond radio when television came along , we should not be na\u00efve as to why News Corp \u2019 s attack dogs are so voracious in their boringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of elitist , inner-city , Marxist , fifth-column .\nIt is the most contemptible misrepresentation of a dedicated staff that lives in every kind of community across the length and breadth of Australia , like no other media organisation .\nI \u2019 ve said it before and I \u2019 ll keep saying it for as long as I have to , ABC journalists , like those I worked alongside for decades , are not driven by ideology but by the desire to pursue their craft the way they \u2019 re supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysing the news , faithfully , accurately and responsibly ; and in the process holding the powerful to account and keeping government honest .\nWhen I was in the chair at 7.30 in the Howard years , John Howard \u2019 s office used to refer to the ABC \u2019 s relationship with regional and rural Australia as , \u201c Our enemy talking to our friends \u201d .\nMaybe by that they meant that the ABC was poisoning conservative voters in the bush with its mythical left-wing slant on news .\nWhat I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ABC was harder to manipulate than much of the rest of the media and was less inclined to be compliant , in its coverage to the bush and everywhere else .\nI also think it goes some way to understanding the mentality within conservative ranks that has driven the sense of hostility and desire to punish , reflected in the Howard years , and over this past nine years of the Abbott , Turnbull and Morrison governments .\nThe recurring pattern is bizarre .\nThe big black-and-white pre-election promise not to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely and shamelessly in the immediate post-election budget by a significant cut to the ABC \u2019 s budget .\nHoward did it .\nAbbott did it .\nTurnbull and Morrison continued it .\nSince Abbott , the ABC has lost 10.6 % of its budget in real terms .\nThat is hundreds of millions of dollars .\nAnd now , in the shadow of another election , suddenly the Minister for the ABC , who declined the Friends \u2019 invitation to front you here today , scrambles to undo the freeze imposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments for inflation which effectively amounted to cutting another $ 40 million a year .\nFor a start , the government \u2019 s formula for indexation does not reflect the true measure of inflation , but even if it did , why would we trust this promise given the track record of broken promises in the past ?\nThe ABC has so far resisted both the public attacks and the depleted budgets , but anyone who has followed dear old Auntie for any length of time knows that damage has been done .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to measure , but real , engrained damage to the psyche of the place as well as its programs that will be hard to undo .\nDare I say it , Labor governments have showed their frustrations , even outright anger with ABC coverage that has stung them too , but at least Labor has had a long-term philosophical commitment to the principle of public broadcasting \u2014 but if Labor does win this election , it has serious ground to make up to demonstrate its adherence to that principle and restore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat means going beyond what it \u2019 s committed to so far .\nI don \u2019 t claim some hallowed status for the ABC .\nIt \u2019 s had its stumbles and its imperfections too .\nAnd given the level of trust invested in it by its audience , and given the investment of public funds as well , it should never resent a strong , sensible , justifiable level of public scrutiny \u2014 but I have to say from my decades of experience in the place , I can not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC , short of the Parliament itself .\nAnd the irony there , of course , is that the workings of government in Australia are becoming more and more opaque , more and more resistant to scrutiny \u2014 another symptom of our fraying democracy .\nSo , for all the concerns I \u2019 ve outlined , I have been accepting invitations on behalf of ABC Alumni , from independent candidates in various electorates to air the same concerns I \u2019 ve been expressing today \u2014 not to endorse any individual candidate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to vote , but to challenge them to think carefully about how precious their vote is , and how they can make it speak for their values and their most important needs .\nBut I have to say I couldn \u2019 t help but be impressed , not just by the quality of the candidates themselves but the small armies of highly motivated , highly articulate volunteers who have emerged from within their communities determined to have their voices heard , protesting what they clearly see as a decline in the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe it when I heard John Howard referring to these women so disparagingly as \u201c anti-Liberal groupies \u201d .\nUnusually clumsy for one of the wiliest politicians in Australia \u2019 s post-war era .\nWhat an appallingly sexist putdown to the Zoe Daniels , the Zali Steggalls , the Allegra Spenders , the Monique Ryans , the Kate Hooks and all the other fiercely intelligent and independent women who have stood up to be counted because their communities are losing faith in mainstream politics .\nI \u2019 d like to finish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been such stalwarts over decades and who \u2019 ve already started manning the polling booths with a message to all Australians as they walk past

homeowner grants , stamp duty concessions , mortgage deposit guarantee schemes , shared equity schemes , preferential tax treatment for property investors , and indeed lower interest rates or reductions in credit standards \u2013- results , primarily , in higher house prices rather than higher rates of home ownership .\nThe scheme announced by the government yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay up to $ 250,000 and couples up to $ 600,000 more for housing than they otherwise would ( based on the maximum amount people can take out of their super , which then becomes part of their deposit ,

normally leverage into super , whereas they do into residential property , so this scheme exposes people to greater overall asset price and interest rate risks than they would otherwise face , as well

to score a mention in the Liberal Party \u2019 s campaign launch yesterday .\nFollowing a surge in demand for domestic violence services throughout the pandemic , years dominated by allegations of sexual violence , and a recession forcing women into unpaid caring roles and underemployment , it was a glaring \u2014 but very deliberate \u2014 omission by the Liberal Party .\nThe campaign was opened by Liberal candidate for Griffith Olivia Roberts , a rare opportunity for a woman to appeal to female voters , but she instead spent more time criticising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg .\nBy the time Prime Minister Scott Morrison took the stage , it was just past 12.30pm .\nHe mentioned women about a quarter of the way into his speech \u2014 a throwaway line about the Coalition \u2019 s \u201c record investments \u201d in \u201c protecting women from violence and abuse \u201d .\nMorrison unveiled his three new policies : allowing first-home buyers to access superannuation to enter the property market ; incentives for older homeowners downsizing their houses ; and $ 375 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny , of course , scored a mention : \u201c For most , including Jen and I , [ a home ] is the largest asset you will ever own and it is a source of your security in retirement.\n\u201d It is also an asset men are more likely to own than women .\nWomen aged 55 and over are the fastest-growing cohort of homeless Australians , with the number of homeless older women increasing by 31 % between 2011 and 2016 .\nBut once again , the Coalition has failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will affect equity in Australia \u2014 and specifically how , once again , these will advance the assets of older white males over anyone else in this country .\nIt \u2019 s a throwback to the paltry 2020 budget , which distinctly lacked any analysis on how budget decisions affected women .\nMorrison argued at the time that women benefited greatly from the budget because they too could access boosts to business , tax relief , and better roads .\nWhat his budget did was worsen the divide between men and women : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children or women fleeing violence .\nAfter public outcry , this was addressed in the next two budgets with some analysis of how women would be affected by funding decisions .\nBut it seems the message didn \u2019 t stick : Morrison \u2019 s flagship new policy allowing first-home buyers to access superannuation to enter the property market will once again widen inequalities between men and women .\nSuperannuation is a sticking point in gender equity , with a gap of 22 % -35 % between Australian men and women in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superannuation gap for women aged 60 to 64 is 28 % , or a difference of $ 57,207 \u2014 a huge figure in a time of rising inflation .\nIt \u2019 s estimated that across the pandemic up to 70,000 women may have been coerced into withdrawing their superannuation by abusive partners .\nAustralians aren \u2019 t paid superannuation on parental leave \u2014 a flaw that Labor , several independent candidates and the Greens have pledged to fix , though the Coalition has not .\nSoaring house costs have seen the gender gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the census doesn \u2019 t collect gendered data on homeownership , one analysis found as of January 2022 men had exclusive ownership of 29.9 % of homes compared with 26.6 % of properties owned by women .\nWomen own about 7 % fewer investment properties than men .\nWith a pay gap of almost 14 % , it takes women a full year longer than men to save a 20 % deposit for a home , with women more likely to work in part-time and insecure positions .\nThis worsened across the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the labour force and do unpaid work , and less likely to receive government support .\nSix months out of work can add another $ 100,000 to the $ 2 million average lifetime earnings gap between men and women , the Grattan Institute has found .\nAsk the Morrison government and it \u2019 ll point to the Home Guarantee Scheme , which allowed single parents to buy their first home with a deposit of 2 % .\nMorrison said in his speech that 85 % of the 2200 who benefited were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 877,800 single mums across the country .\nThe Morrison government has made record investments in women \u2019 s safety .\nBut without addressing drivers of sexual violence or necessary protections in advancing gender equity \u2014 or simply keeping Australian women off the streets \u2014 once again its policies support one very specific cohort of people over another .", "author": "Amber Schultz", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/16/women-coalitions-campaign-launch-homeownership-policy/",

government millions: tell the minister I sent you", "content": "This is part of an ongoing series .\nFor the rest of the articles , go here .\nA document obtained by Crikey under freedom of information ( FOI ) laws reveals the key role Liberal Party connections played in the awarding of a multimillion-dollar grant to the notorious Esther Foundation , a Pentecostal-linked rehab facility for girls and young women based in Perth .\nThe facility is now the subject of a Western Australian parliamentary inquiry following our revelations of serious religion-based abuse .\nAs Crikey has reported , Scott Morrison announced the $ 4 million grant prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation \u2019 s headquarters in the marginal Liberal seat of Hasluck , held by Ken Wyatt .\nThe FOI document reveals that the Esther Foundation sent its submission directly to Health Minister Greg Hunt rather than to the Health Department , which administers the grant .\nThe submission highlighted that the request for funding \u201c was suggested by our local federal member for Hasluck , Ken Wyatt AM MP \u201d .\nThe foundation \u2019 s submission was marked as being received in Hunt \u2019 s office on February 7 .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By March 7 the government had approved the $ 4 million grant in time for Morrison \u2019 s pre-election visit to the foundation , where he hailed the work of the facility .\nHe also took personal credit for the taxpayer-funded grant , telling staff and residents : \u201c I don \u2019 t invest in things that don \u2019 t work.\n\u201d A Crikey investigation earlier this year , however , revealed residents , some as young as 14 , had been subject to physical , mental and sexual abuse at the facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time of Morrison \u2019 s visit and the approval of the grant .\nLast month the Western Australian Parliament announced an inquiry into the Esther Foundation after receiving testimonies from more than 50 former residents .\nThe scale and the consistency of the revelations led the state government to immediately suspend any further dealings with the foundation .\nA Facebook group set up for Esther survivors now has more than 250 members , while the foundation has gone into voluntary administration .\nSo , how did the Morrison government come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just four weeks , with no competitive tender , to an organisation that has scarred the lives of hundreds of girls , some as young as 14 ?\nWe still don \u2019 t know .\nThe single document released to Crikey under FOI , after a 60-day wait , sheds no light on that key question .\nThe Health Department told us in January that it had provided a \u201c risk assessment \u201d to Hunt \u2019 s office , but it refused to provide that to Crikey .\nIn our FOI request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Department and Hunt \u2019 s office .\nUltimately the department only came up with the Esther Foundation \u2019 s submission to Hunt \u2019 s office , revealing the key role of Ken Wyatt .\nThere was no sign of any departmental risk assessment given to Hunt .\nThere has also been confusion about which federal program funded the grant .\nThe Health Department has disputed the public record , which shows that the $ 4 million was paid under the government \u2019 s Community Health and Hospitals Program ( CHHP ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Morrison to enable direct grants from the Commonwealth .\nHealth experts warned that the grants fund departed from the usual protocols of federal-state health funding and could be used as a slush fund for marginal seats .\nThe fast-tracking of Esther \u2019 s request \u2014 and the political connections behind the request \u2014 meant the religious-based foundation was able to avoid the usual processes and scrutiny applied to others .\nThe Esther Foundation has for years been favoured by Western Australia \u2019 s liberal politicians .\nFormer Western Australian premier Colin Barnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe foundation \u2019 s founder , Patricia Lavater , had cultivated relations with former federal Liberal MP Steve Irons .\nThe foundation has also maintained close relations with Perth \u2019 s Pentecostal churches , which in turn have built close connections with local Liberal Party branches .\nWyatt also visited the foundation on a number of occasions and accompanied Morrison when he announced the $ 4 million grant .\nAccording to Crikey \u2018 s Esther sources , the foundation played up its work with First Nations young women and girls , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit .\nWyatt has been Minister for Indigenous peoples in the Morrison government and has a long record in Aboriginal education in Western Australia .\nCrikey provided a series of questions to Wyatt about his support for the foundation and whether or not he was aware of any allegations of abuse .\nA response provided to Crikey failed to address any of the questions .\nSo , what happens to the money now ?\nThe fast-track , no-tender grant made to the Esther Foundation casts a further pall over the Health Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages its grant and procurement processes .\nFour Corners earlier this month revealed that Aspen Medical had been awarded close to a billion dollars in federal government contracts without tender for COVID services .\nAspen is a donor to the Liberal Party and it employs former Liberal health minister Michael Wooldridge as one of its key lobbyists .\nCrikey asked the Health Department what arrangements had been made to recoup funds in excess of a million dollars that had already gone to Esther .\nWe also asked for the advice it had provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transparency .\nThe department said it couldn \u2019 t comment , citing government caretaker conventions .\nHunt , of course , is retiring in this week \u2019 s election .\nWyatt is fighting for his political life in Hasluck .\nAs far as we know , no organisation linked to him or his electorate has received a spare $ 4 million of taxpayers \u2019 funds \u2014 yet .", "author": "David Hardaker", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/17/how-get-your-hands-on-government-millions/", "published": "Mon, 16 May 2022 23:40:42 +0000",

piece doesn \u2019 t say .\nFortuitously for a prime minister with a woman problem , Harrington can attest to Morrison \u2019 s \u201c intense connection \u201d with his \u201c family of women \u201d ( that would be Jen and the girls ) , which makes him committed to \u201c shaping a better deal for women \u201d .\nMorrison is also apparently \u201c a great listener \u201d and not a bulldozer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the prime minister \u2019 s office has its fingerprints all over it .\nBut surely not .\nThe masthead ran a corresponding personal take on Anthony Albanese , written by an old university friend , Alex Bukarica , who was described as a lawyer , godfather to Albanese \u2019 s son , and a member of the ALP .\nIn the Morrison piece , which went to the PM \u2019 s political

.\nAdrian Harrington was never far away .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and real estate business .\nWhen Morrison was treasurer he handed Harrington an appointment on the government \u2019 s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation ( NHFIC ) board .\nIn 2019 the Morrison government appointed Harrington as chair of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute , a government body that advises on housing and homelessness .\n( The institute has become a stomping ground for Morrison government friends , such as former senator Karen Synon , also a deputy president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on $ 500,000 a year .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need is a friend indeed , and it \u2019 s nice to see the Harringtons being able to give a hand to the Morrisons .\nCrikey has also identified

was announced , \u201c a head of iceberg lettuce \u201d likely wasn \u2019 t on the list .\nBut the leafy green has had a huge impact on how Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese tailored their campaign messages , with the cost of living dominating almost every press conference , leaders debate and meet and greet .\nIt was something the Coalition likely didn \u2019 t plan on either : while they flagged higher costs earlier in the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his budget bribes would distract voters from higher bills , while the invasion of Ukraine would absolve him of any blame .\nBut it \u2019 s been the opposite .\nA simple head of the worst kind of lettuce turned it all upside-down \u2014 prompting Labor to pretend economic management was always one of its talking points and putting Morrison on the back foot , insisting there \u2019 s no \u201c magic solution \u201d to lowering food costs .\nHere \u2019 s how it all unfolded .\nThe timing of the election was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the generous federal budget .\nIt put the Coalition on the front , with plenty of cash handouts at the ready to appease voters and distract them from anything unfortunate around them \u2014 say , surging COVID-19 rates or floods .\nMorrison , being Morrison , wanted to get ahead of any negative press around rising food costs .\nIn early March , he warned business leaders of higher costs \u2014 but was quick to absolve politics of any blame .\n\u201c Food and grain prices are rising , which will pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own region , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We are not immune from the negative impacts of Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine on global growth as well.\n\u201d To address these increased costs , he included a tidy $ 250 payment to some Australians in the budget \u2014 again stressing that this was Russia \u2019 s fault , ignoring that prices had been on the up for months .\nCampaigns kicked off as planned , with both parties going along with their expected messaging .\nThey each had their focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stressed , was a \u201c government that you know and that has been delivering and a Labor opposition that you don \u2019 t \u201d .\nAlbanese , on the other hand , focused on the opportunity to give Australia a \u201c better future \u201d with a focus on integrity and respect .\nFor the Liberals , it was all about the economy , unemployment and jobs , lower taxes , infrastructure and national security .\nFor Labor , the messages were aged care and childcare , unemployment and jobs , climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cost of living \u2014 but with a focus on childcare policies over groceries .\nOn March 30 , a photo of a head of iceberg lettuce selling for $ 5.50 at Coles went viral on Reddit .\nBut neither major party picked up on it , trundling out the same old lines they \u2019 d been planning for months .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until April 29 that Albanese apparently picked up on the Reddit thread and ran with it in an interview on the Today show .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iceberg lettuce $ 5.50 .\nFor an iceberg lettuce .\nIt used to be a couple of bucks.\n\u201d It dominated the second leaders debate too , with 60 Minutes reporter Sarah Abo asking both leaders on May 8 : \u201c What can you do to actually reduce the cost of lettuce and , even on a day like Mother \u2019 s Day , the cost of flowers ?\n\u201d Albanese \u2019 s comment wasn \u2019 t the only thing that put cost of living front and centre of the debate : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of Australia raised the cash rate by 25 basis points .\nData on inflation , employment and real wages was released and both leaders were soon peppered with questions on what they planned to do about it .\nBut Albanese \u2019 s lettuce remark had got the ball \u2014 or head \u2014 rolling .\nA can of worms for gotcha questions The coverage boded well for Albanese , positioning him as an \u201c everyday guy \u201d who bought groceries just like everyone else .\nIt was also a jab at Morrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to name the price of a loaf of bread , a litre of petrol and a rapid antigen test .\n\u201c I wasn \u2019 t going to pretend to you that I go out each day and I buy a loaf of bread and I buy a litre of milk , \u201d Morrison said in reply .\nHe was later \u201c supported \u201d by Employment Minister Stuart Robert who said if Morrison \u2019 s wife Jenny was with him she \u2019 d be able to \u201c rattle off all the prices of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt also paved the way for journalists to ask even more \u201c gotcha \u201d questions .\nIf the leaders were so well versed in their campaign messages and the struggles of everyday Australians , why couldn \u2019 t Albanese reel off the six points of his policy on the National Disability Insurance Scheme ?\nWhy did Morrison struggle with questions on basic pricing ?\nWhy couldn \u2019 t Albanese provide data on the unemployment and cash rates ?\nBut both leaders \u2019 continued to jump down each other \u2019 s throats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotcha gaffes as campaign fodder \u2014 while conveniently ignoring his own .\nBut back to the lettuce : after the second leaders debate , lettuce had taken off , with Labor releasing lettuce-themed memes to drill the point home .\nWe also saw a spike in Australians googling the cost of living .\nAs data provided by Isentia for Crikey \u2019 s Campaign Insights revealed today , both leaders had to widen their messaging , forced to fight on one another \u2019 s turf .\nWhile Labor had always gone strong on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve been forced to reposition themselves as the strong economic managers instead of the Coalition .\nIt \u2019 s put the Liberals on the back foot \u2014 forced to release a depressing rendition

for , didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and weren \u2019 t happy with the Coalition .\nEven in 2019 the disparity was apparent \u2013just 35 % of women put the Liberal Party first compared with 45 % of men .\n( Comparable data has not yet been released about this election . )\nIt was a three-year term filled with allegations of sexual violence following the Me Too movement , report after report on gender rankings and workplace sexual harassment showing the dire situation , and lived experience of worsening conditions as women working on the COVID-19 frontlines dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWith already low support , it would make sense for the Liberals to attempt to appeal to angry , disenfranchised or undecided women .\nInstead Morrison set about making things worse .\nThere was a series of incredibly offensive blunders , from deflecting to his children when discussing rape to patting himself on the back when faced with reports of a toxic , misogynistic parliamentary workplace , to downplaying allegations against former cabinet ministers Christian Porter and Alan Tudge , denied by both men .\nAnd it appears Morrison \u2019 s workplace-mandated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so far .\nWomen were left out across the election campaign , the Coalition apparently forgetting women have had the right to vote in this country for 120 years .\nFrontline workers didn \u2019 t get a mention from Morrison since the budget .\nIn his concession speech , Morrison thanked the defence force , police and tradies \u2014 male-dominated industries that didn \u2019 t have to bear the brunt of COVID like healthcare workers , teachers and aged care workers .\nDespite changing his tune and voicing support for gender quotas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison made no moves to improve representation ; female candidates were overlooked to run in safe seats by both sides ; and a number of Liberal women , including Fiona Martin in Reid , lost their seats .\nInstead he had Liberal woman after Liberal woman turn against him \u2014 from Julie Bishop declaring men in Parliament weren \u2019 t doing enough to advocate for women , to Bridget Archer crossing the floor over religious discrimination , to Julia Banks and Gladys Berejiklian abandoning the party .\nThe list goes on .\nMorrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had forgotten women in the budget \u2014 instead dedicated much of this year \u2019 s funding to women , pledging cash to struggling domestic violence shelters .\nBut he failed to address the root drivers of gendered violence or inequality , again focusing on policies that benefit men over women in his campaign launch .\nThe closest Australia got to an admission that Morrison \u2019 s actions weren \u2019 t being received well was a promise to be less of a \u201c bulldozer \u201d and to change his leadership style .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later said that \u2014 even after refusing to meet protesters on the day of the women \u2019 s March 4 Justice rally ( telling women they should be grateful they weren \u2019 t shot ) \u2014 if he had his time again he wouldn \u2019 t change a thing .\nWe knew it was coming .\nWomen and strong female independents led the revolution against the Coalition .\nMorrison time and again underestimated the wrath of angry women \u2014 and it cost him the election .\nThe results are a reason to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting cohort in Australia .", "author": "Amber Schultz", "url":

first it was \u201c YES YES YES \u201d , then \u201c Don \u2019 t say sweetest victory of all \u201d , then \u201c Hmmm , what exactly happened ?\n\u201d Your correspondent \u2019 s view of the nation , developing throughout the campaign , had been that the most exuberant and energetic forces in the country were developing among the knowledge class and the broader liberal middle classes .\nThese were people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying and rorting , as well as the lack of any sense of a future plan , with no place for them in the Liberals , no sense of connection to a post-Whitlamite Labor , and the Greens too left on multiple fronts .\nThe new social self-confidence of these sub-classes , the changes made by social media , a lot of organising by the movement springing from Indi , supercharged by money from Climate 200 , had made a new supercharged force whose networked form mimicked the work/life arrangements they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills and abilities , in what became a virtuous circle .\nThe more such people heard each other , the more the movement recruited itself .\nThis worked in both liberal urban areas and in country places where volunteer community networks remained strong .\nAgainst this it seemed to me was , at the other end , about 10 % of the populace oriented to UAP , One Nation , etc \u2014 certain types of Anglo \u201c ordinary \u201d middle class , together with some of the excluded and other blocs .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these parties told , of vaccine conspiracies connecting to larger conspiracies about thwarted lives and lost culture .\nBut in between these two vocal groups , there was about a quarter to a third of the electorate who had gone silent rather than quiet .\nTheir sense of atomisation and disengagement was now total ; they did not even identify with the self-declared populists who by the very fact of being within the system had become part of it , not their representatives within it .\nOnce they might have found their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lower-level educational skills , isolation and disconnection , they found that the only way of preserving their identity and sense of self \u2014 among all that blah blah blah , all that discourse \u2014 was to withdraw so entirely that their feelings were difficult to gauge by any method whatsoever .\nMy guess was that the energy propelling Labor forward would meet this force , which tilted strongly towards the Coalition \u2014 though with no admiration for Scott Morrison \u2014 and would reduce Labor \u2019 s forward march to a majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of a hung parliament .\nSo , uh , *checks notes* .\nThis is a complex result , with that surge of progressivism occurring and giving a sense of a landslide , delivering Labor several seats in these prog heartlands , and some swings that came very close to delivering it another five or six .\nYet Labor \u2019 s result will sit on the border of majority government , with between 75 and 78 seats .\nThough a Labor majority looks more likely than not , it \u2019 s a bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the months and years ahead .\nThe progressive surge was even more so in the areas won , or almost won , by the Greens \u2014 Ryan and Griffith , a maybe in Macnamara , close in Richmond .\nIt delivered exactly what it promised in half a dozen teal seats .\nThere was also the \u201c rust \u201d surge \u2014 I \u2019 m going to keep calling rural teals rusts until it takes \u2014 who hollowed out National safe majorities across the land .\nBut Labor couldn \u2019 t really surge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 places where UAP and One Nation have no more than their 8 % or so hard-right aggregate , but where a degree of resistance to the new progressive package is expressed by refusal .\nThus Labor could not take Longman in the Brisbane exurbs , and has only a small chance of getting Casey in Melbourne \u2019 s outer north-east .\nIn Tasmania , the last region where there \u2019 s a thorough working-class dominance of political culture , it could not take Bass or Braddon ( even with Lambie preferences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards in Lyons .\nIt \u2019 s true the Coalition did not get the great revolt in these \u2018 burban lands it was hoping for .\nSo that suggests to me that while the , or a , great progressive moment has occurred in Australian politics and which represents the broadening of the \u201c progressive class \u201d , it was not the victory of a grand coalition .\nPower and ideological hegemony have shifted decisively , and progressives should be bold in asserting their agenda .\nBut in the places where people still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect with power or the means to get it , where there \u2019 s no point talking about coming up from public housing because there is none , there remains a resistance to the narrative and the whole progressive worldview .\nAnthony Albanese , if he is any sort of Labor leader , will need to find a way not only to deliver both the progressive vision and for the needs of the silent and excluded \u2014 he and Labor will need to honour their view of what the world is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in this term and a triumph in the next .\nStill , go

zero \u201d goal : the cessation of new fossil fuel projects and the rapid phase-out of unabated coal-fired power .\nIf they are to deliver on their commitment to stronger climate action , the teal independents and the Greens must push Labor hard to move much more rapidly towards decarbonisation \u2014 including by preventing new fossil fuel export projects and shutting down existing ones .\nSo in an important sense it \u2019 s merely that one phase of the climate wars has ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s a theme Crikey has repeated for a while : we need to resolve this tension between those

Institute , among others .\n\u2022 There was a clear downward trend in the use of traditional news media : print had halved since 2016 ; most Australians ( 80 % ) said they had not read a newspaper or magazine in the past week ; 4 % said they primarily get news from print publications ; access to a regional or local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % in the same period \u2022 40 % nominated TV as their main source of news \u2022 Women , younger generations and those with low incomes were less likely to see themselves or their views as being fairly or sufficiently reflected in the news \u2022 When it came to political news , left-wing and right-wing audiences believed their political views were unfairly represented \u2022 Only 13 % of Australians paid for online news , and most ( 83 % ) said it was unlikely they would pay in the future \u2022 The decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gradual shift from traditional news platforms towards online and social media news sources .\nIn 2021 , about one-quarter ( 23 % ) of news consumers primarily used social media , which was a 5 % increase from 2019 .\nThe rise is particularly noticeable among older people .\nInto this growing void of news and trust has stepped Twitter .\nFor the past three years , one of its most influential citizen journalist-commentators has been a woman with the online identity \u201c Ronni Salt \u201d , who has remained anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest stories of in recent years .\nThese include the dealings of former energy minister Angus Taylor , the story of the QAnon friend of the Morrison family , and Scott

lives in rural Australia .\nShe writes on government corruption and climate as well as gender equality and sexual violence .\n\u201c I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells Crikey .\nThe issues she pursues overlap precisely with the top three \u201c values \u201d of the teal independents .\nRonni Salt is not alone in using an online pseudonym ( or maybe more accurately a nom de guerre ) .\nAnother is \u201c PRGuy \u201d , who runs a staunch defence of the ALP .\nPR Guy has 76,000 followers compared with Ronni Salt \u2019 s 83,000 .\n( Also it appears that \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 Ronni Salt \u2019 s Twitter account is deactivated . )\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a social media account is a front for political interests .\nRonni Salt has previously declared she is not in the pay of anyone .\nShe told Crikey she has concealed her true identity in part for self-preservation .\n\u201c Look at the absolutely scandalous degradation of good people like Dr Monique Ryan , Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court , Dr Sophie Scamps , Zoe Daniel , et cetera , \u201d she said .\n\u201c When I have seen what has happened to them in public life , purely for exercising their democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as far as I \u2019 m aware , are serial killers \u2014 but they have been followed and harassed and harangued both inside Parliament and predominantly outside Parliament .\n\u201c They have been absolutely torn to shreds for the crime of daring to stand for election and daring to question the conduct of our democracy and the government \u2019 s integrity .\nSo I think there \u2019 s a very , very real price to pay for being outspoken and for questioning the status quo \u2026 That \u2019 s not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscathed .\nI \u2019 ve certainly paid a price.\n\u201d Ronni Salt sees Twitter functioning in part as a \u201c fifth estate \u201d holding the mainstream media to account and creating a separate take on the news .\nStaking a position outside and at times against the established media has set up a culture clash on the question of how \u201c journalism \u201d is practised .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been interesting to watch the fourth estate , who is allegedly holding power to account , be held to account themselves , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang away on Twitter about something and surprisingly discover that it \u2019 s something that \u2019 s picked up a couple of days later , even though it \u2019 s not necessarily an issue until a blue tick person [ a Twitter-accredited person ] says it .\n\u201c And I understand the reasons behind that , too .\nI do actually appreciate that there is this whole different set of standards that comes with publication in one of the mainstreams and that there \u2019 s a whole different risk level for the journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter of how the media does its business is legitimate .\n\u201c There are really quite rational and intelligent people making comment on the calibre of questions that are asked in press conferences and questioning the way that drops [ of exclusive information ] and leaks happen with the media , questioning why a particular journalist is running with a particular story at a particular time and the marketing tie-ins that happen with them.\n\u201d She is at loggerheads with a handful of \u201c blue tick \u201d journalists , but says she respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them .\nAt its heart , though , what \u2019 s at stake is a battle for trust .\nThe journalism establishment has been steadily losing ground on that measure .\nThe last election was perhaps its lowest point .\nThe Twitter model of communities of people working together on the basis of shared values has perhaps created a model of trust that is underwritten by how easy it is to interact with each other , pretty much instantly .\nNames \u2014 real or made up \u2014 don \u2019 t really matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads normally yield about 500,000 \u201c impressions \u201d .\nHer most-read tweet , on Scott Morrison \u2019 s incapacity to lead the country during COVID lockdown , had 1.3 million impressions \u2014 more readers than many mainstream journalists achieve , but as she points out not in the same league as the saturation coverage achieved by cross-media networks .\n\u201c But I think one of the interesting points is that if you do put out information that is intelligent and succinct and has a salient point , you will get other journalists reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other politicians , political staffers , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I know there are a lot of political staffers who follow my account .\nAnd so you will have an impact there .\nSo you may not directly influence the debate , but you can influence the people who influence the debate.\n\u201d And how much of a role did Ronni Salt play in the rise of the community independents ?\n\u201c There is a massive network that has been responsible for the rise of the independents .\nAnd it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 ve certainly been incredibly supportive and outspoken in relation to the rise of the independents \u2019 movement , but I would consider myself to be one drop of water in the wave .\n\u201d", "author": "David

bedroom .\n\u201c The causes of the defeat in Kooyong to the \u2018 teals \u2019 can be applied across Australia , indeed it \u2019 s a global phenomenon that wealthy inner-urban elites are voting for the Left \u2026 These [ the forgotten people ] are the Australians who will bear the brunt of what the \u2018 teals \u2019 are demanding in terms of emissions reductions by 2030 .\nThe people of Kooyong , Wentworth , Goldstein , North Sydney and Mackellar aren \u2019 t forgotten or quiet .\nThey are loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through or just crash , eh , Tim ?\n\u201c Dave Sharma has been cast aside in Wentworth after just a solitary term by voters who preferred super-wealthy tealian Allegra Spender \u2026 If voters in urban seats are now so rich that they can afford to discard meaningful parliamentary representation , it clears the field for the Liberals to reinvent themselves as a party primarily concerned with the cost of living.\n\u201d On Radio National , Leichhardt member Warren Entsch talked of \u201c billionaire \u201d Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court running the teals through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blotted his progressive copybook with a bit of misogyny as well .\nIn the lead-up to the election , Janet Albrechtsen had already portrayed teals and their supporters as \u201c posh thickos \u201d .\nAnd every evening Paul Murray begins his hypnotically Pravda-esque hour on Sky with a sort of simpering play act of the new independents , in which this human pub-raffle meat-tray affects the voices of what he calls the \u201c Tiffany teals \u201d .\nThis , and much more of it , is all\u2026 courageous .\nThe working assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the party of \u201c the forgotten people \u201d \u2014 low-to-middle income suburbanites in our era \u2014 in part by actively attacking the wealthy above them .\nThis is the sort of thing professional political activists might assume would work , because their lives are based on orienting themselves towards an enemy .\nBut of course most people who are the \u201c strivers \u201d don \u2019 t think like that .\nThe energetic , aspirational people that the Liberals want to attract in outer suburban seats may find well-off teal seaters to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not organised around their resentment of them .\nThey want the things such teals have \u2014 a big house in a good place , good education for their children , the freedom that money brings to shape a life .\nThey may not choose the same type of house or neighbourhood , but they have the same sort of idea of what constitutes prosperity and success .\nTry to run a break between the aspirational and the successful and you get a different type of politics .\nThe right want the Liberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the defenders of cheaper energy prices , greater home ownership , and job security through economic management .\nBut to do this while sneering at wealth is an anti-aspirational politics , one of modesty and acceptance .\nIt is far closer to DLP politics \u2014 of a modest , abstemious , repressed , Catholic middle class \u2014 than it is to Liberal individualism .\nThe Australian right think that in doing this , they are mimicking Trump \u2019 s populism .\nBut they have it completely wrong .\nTrump never sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth .\nNor did he argue any connection between wealth and the elite values his supporters abhorred .\nWealth was good any way you got it .\nHe wanted to spread it around .\nHe posed in front of a gold elevator to say \u201c Hey , it \u2019 s not a zero-sum game .\nWe can all get some.\n\u201d When he attacked \u201c crooked \u201d Hillary or \u201c lying Nancy \u201d Pelosi , he made their elitism about political power , not money .\nHe avoided the sort of strangled resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the teals .\nFurthermore Trump was able to transform the Republican Party quickly , because it had long since lost the support of the north-eastern WASP elites who had run it for decades .\nThey transferred to the Democrats in 1964 , after concerted efforts by other groupings within the mega-party took the Republicans rightwards .\nBut the Liberal Party is nothing like that .\nIt remains utterly dominated by the intersecting , largely Anglo-Saxon networks of the major private schools , and the way in which they undergird a whole social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these networks , and those coming up , are not about to give up that power to the branches of the outer suburbs \u2014 or to hand the party over .\nSo the idea seems to be that they will run a deepfake of sorts .\nThe plan seems to be that the Tim Smiths and Peta Credlins and all sorts will go out to the suburbs and preach to the forgotten people about the inner-city elites who are taking advantage of them .\nIn their trauma , the right are currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 \u201c forgotten people \u201d speech , which turned 80 last week .\nHow did Sir Robert handle the problem of the rich ?\nHe simply ruled them out while defining \u201c the middle classes \u201d \u2014 \u201c I exclude at one end of the scale the rich and powerful : those who control great funds and enterprises , and are as a rule able to protect themselves \u2014 though it must be said that in a political sense they have as a rule shown neither comprehension nor competence.\n\u201d \u2014 then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy and large , \u201c the forgotten people \u201d is not a class war speech ( though pretty uninterested in the working class ) in the manner the right are trying to mount .\nMenzies argues that each class has its way of life , and what he seeks to do is define that of the middle class : \u201c The case for the middle class is the case for a dynamic democracy as against the stagnant one .\nStagnant waters are level , and in them the scum rises .\nActive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tumble and have crests and troughs ; but the scientists tell us that they purify themselves in a few hundred yards \u2026 But what really happens to us will depend on how many people we have who are of the great and sober and dynamic middle-class \u2014 the strivers , the planners , the ambitious ones .\nWe shall destroy them at our peril.\n\u201d That would seem to describe the teals rather more than Tim Smith \u2014 especially that \u201c sober \u201d bit .\nHow strange , but scarcely unusual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speech disguises from them that they are acting against its dominant spirit .\nThe ironies are practically endless .\nIf Tim Smith , man of the people , had managed to put his Jag all the way through that child \u2019 s bedroom wall , the person who might have to save them could well have been Monique Ryan , paediatric neurosurgeon , now MP for Kooyong , and pretty much the sort of person whose

the material being used against him .\nThat was rejected by the ACT Court of Appeal .\nThe Commonwealth also fought \u2014 and won the first round \u2014 to prevent Collaery from subpoenaing

.\nUnvaxxed is the second book in The Crikey Read series by Crikey and Hardie Grant Books .\nIt is available to purchase from today .\nOn March 28 , 2020 , the Facebook Messenger app on my phone pinged with a message from mum .\nForwarded from whoever had sent it to her , the message laid out some \u201c important information about the new coronavirus \u201d .\nIt should have been the first Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had just started her first year of school .\nInstead , the term had ended early and abruptly .\nInternational travel was banned , gatherings were curtailed , and two days earlier , my home state of Victoria had recorded its first death from COVID-19 .\nThe world was on edge .\nI was on edge .\n\u201c The virus hates heat , \u201d the message from mum said , \u201c therefore hot drinks such as infusions , broths or simply hot water should be consumed abundantly during the day .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cubes.\n\u201d It went on : \u201c For those who can , sunbathe .\nThe sun \u2019 s UV rays kill the virus and the vitamin D is good for you.\n\u201d According to the poorly punctuated , copy-pasted screed , the advice was originally sent as an internal email to staff at the Royal Brisbane Hospital .\n\u201c Please share with family , friends and work colleagues , \u201d it implored .\nMy mother diligently forwarded a second , abridged version of the same message , a moment after the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 patients \u201d .\nIt was obvious that neither claim was true and , to me at least , that the advice was nonsense .\n\u201c Unfortunately this is total BS , \u201d I replied .\n\u201c Happy to talk \u2014 have spent last few days talking to experts on transmission.\n\u201d Hot water won \u2019 t stop the virus , I told her .\nWashing your hands is a good idea , I said .\nAnd facemasks make a difference , I added , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time .\nA couple of days later , mum sent links to sewing patterns for facemasks , no doubt discovered on the same platform she \u2019 d found the other dubious messages .\nBut a month after that , she sent me a video on YouTube .\n\u201c Have a look at this \u2014 really interesting !\n\u201d she texted .\nThe video was a webinar by Andrew Kaufman , a psychiatrist based in Syracuse , New York state .\nAfter reeling off his credentials , Kaufman laid out his thoughts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nInstead of being caused by a novel virus , Kaufman speculated , COVID-19 was probably caused by some other form of cellular assault \u2014 stress , perhaps , or a toxin \u2014 which was causing microscopic vesicles with a virus-like appearance under the microscope to form inside a person \u2019 s lung tissue .\nOr maybe \u2014 though he couldn \u2019 t find anything in the literature to support his theory \u2014 electromagnetic radiation from 5G mobile phone towers was the culprit .\nAnd those first cases of COVID-19 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of bad seafood , he said .\nI called mum straightaway .\nThe doctor \u2014 who has since disavowed mainstream medicine \u2014 doesn \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s talking about , I said .\nI was terse as I invoked conspiracy theories and the stupidity of people to believe such garbage .\nMum bristled and became defensive at my tone .\n\u201c OK , well I don \u2019 t know .\nThat \u2019 s why I \u2019 m asking , \u201d she said .\nI wonder whether even then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what she shared with me .\nDespite reporting on little else , I barely spoke of the pandemic with my mum over the next year or more .\nMy world contracted around me .\nLockdowns , home-schooling , and interviews about contact tracing , facemasks and specks of contagion carried on air currents dominated my days .\nBut my mum \u2019 s life away from Melbourne proceeded relatively untouched by COVID-19 , which is not to say she wasn \u2019 t dealing with other upheavals .\nA few months before the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sold her house in the leafy hills of Melbourne \u2019 s outskirts and temporarily moved in with her sister in Adelaide .\nThen , at the end of 2020 \u2014 having spent all of five days in lockdown \u2014 she moved again , this time to Canberra , to be closer to my brother and his kids , and to start afresh .\nTwo weeks before Christmas 2020 , they signed a lease together .\nIn August 2021 , Canberra was on the precipice of its first lockdown when my brother texted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of worried about [ mum ] .\nShe \u2019 s gone [ off ] the deep end with COVID conspiracies , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c Anti lockdown , anti vaccine \u2026 all the right-wing loopy stuff from the states , \u201d he wrote .\nHis main concern was for his kids \u2014 aged 11 and nine at the time \u2014 who were being fed a diet of fearful warnings from their grandmother .\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates is bankrolling vaccine development , she told them , and they \u2019 re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter your DNA .\nHer messages at the start of the pandemic suggested she had already tapped into some questionable networks online .\nBut I \u2019 d ignored those crimson-bright warning signs .\nYouTube and Facebook algorithms \u2014 combined with her own tendencies to mistrust Western medicine and government authorities \u2014 had taken her to the darker corners of pandemic denial and conspiracy .\nA week later , my brother contacted me again .\nMum had sent him a link to a YouTube video , \u201c MASS PSYCHOSIS \u2013 How an Entire Population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrays the COVID-19 pandemic as an episode of propaganda-induced society-wide madness , \u00e0 la the 17th-century Salem witch trials in Massachusetts , without ever mentioning the pandemic specifically .\nMy brother tried to tell mum that the science about the pandemic was conclusive .\n\u201c Bullshit , \u201d she replied .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not really about the science but what is being allowed to be reported.\n\u201d I shouldn \u2019 t have taken it personally , but this hit a nerve .\nI called her , told her we were concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice as I berated her for getting all her information from Facebook and YouTube .\nShe started telling me about how fear-mongering propaganda can cause mass , population-wide psychosis .\nThen she turned to defending herself against my attack .\nEventually , she just hung up .\nIn the weeks that followed , she launched a campaign to convince me that truth was on her side , that I was the one who was mistaken .\nWith the vaccine rollout now in full swing around the country , she was determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe \u2019 d send a video link .\nI \u2019 d reply with another link to debunk the video \u2019 s content or expose the liars in the video who were peddling mistruths .\n\u201c If you believe in smear campaigns without knowing both sides that \u2019 s fine .\nCan \u2019 t believe you are so gullible , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c This is a repeat of the things that happened in Nazi Germany .\nThe propaganda is unreal .\nBut then telling you that is pointless so just forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m far from alone in having a significant personal relationship catastrophically rupture over questions of how the pandemic has been managed , and over the COVID-19 vaccines in particular .\nAsk anyone , and they will tell you of a person in their orbit \u2014 a family friend , a brother-in-law , a colleague at work \u2014 who has chosen not to be vaccinated , lost their job because of vaccine mandates , or joined one of the many \u201c freedom \u201d rallies to decry restrictions that have been placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie Leask , a social scientist who is the go-to expert on vaccine refusal , I asked her about the best way to combat anti-vaccine activists .\nHer advice : don \u2019 t give them oxygen .\n\u201c Our perception of what others are doing affects what we think is a norm , and social norms affect vaccination , \u201d she told me .\nThere are good reasons not to shy away from what is a complex and thorny issue .\nVaccine coverage \u2014 though high \u2014 is far from uniform .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vaccination services remain barriers .\nAs a society \u2014 a wealthy one at that \u2014 we should all be concerned that this is the case .\nBut we also need to take an unflinching look at why people who could access vaccines if they wanted to are instead refusing them , despite overwhelming support for vaccines from all corners of the scientific community and regulatory machinery .",

doing things .\nThe world is not far off a global economic crash ; a new regional foreign policy that is not head-bangingly stupid must be put in place ; and climate change and integrity policies must be got rolling .\nA lot of headline stuff .\nNevertheless , the new government must turn its attention , and soon , to the plight of Australian citizen Julian Assange , and make some form of official representation to the US government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the US on espionage and other charges .\nIt should also make representation to the UK government to refuse extradition immediately , and release Assange .\nLet \u2019 s restate the case simply .\nAssange is being sought for prosecution , overwhelmingly for allegedly assisting Chelsea Manning , a leaker , to bypass a password that encrypted hundreds of thousands of files .\nThis is the first time that a publisher of leaked information , as opposed to an actual leaker , has been charged in such a way .\nManning had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a CD and leaked them to WikiLeaks ( Assange has denied knowing Manning \u2019 s identity at the time of online exchanges between herself and WikiLeaks ) .\nThe files dealt with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , Guantanamo and US diplomatic communiques .\nShe has already been convicted of espionage and other charges , served her time and been pardoned .\nThe centre of the case against Assange \u2014 17 charges of espionage , one of computer intrusion \u2014 is that in allegedly communicating with Manning , and then suggesting ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importuned the files \u2019 removal and \u201c made them live \u201d .\nYet these are the sorts of things that journalists and publishers have done with leaked files as part of standard practice .\nGet documents picked up and copied , jemmy open a locked briefcase , use experts to work out shorthand and handwriting in leaked files \u2014 everything that Assange is accused of doing in a digital setting has long been standard practice of reporting leaked material .\nThe US charges are thus an attack on journalism , done by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and published , after months of cooperative work , on US soil by The New York Times , whose editors and publishers have not been charged with anything .\nThe Morrison government made no objection at all to extradition , trusting in \u201c the British justice system \u201d , and implicitly supporting US prosecution through silence .\nAlbanese Labor looks like it will be little better .\n\u201c As an Australian citizen , he is entitled to consular assistance , \u201d Penny Wong stated in April .\n\u201c We also expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK and US that he \u2019 s treated fairly and humanely \u2026 Consular matters are regularly raised with counterparts , they are regularly raised and this one would be no different.\n\u201d This is pathetic and gutless .\nLabor should honour the basic commitment to free speech and the investigation of hidden power that was an essential task of the labour movement in establishing its right to exist , and its capacity to succeed .\nThe government is not required to stand with every citizen in trouble abroad , but this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being threatened with decades of prison for activities that are essential to the sort of journalism that is constitutive of a pluralist and open society , built on free speech and free inquiry .\nLabor is being completely hypocritical in its silence on Assange .\nIn 2018 and 2019 , it was very happy to use the leaks-based story by Annika Smethurst on the increased surveillance of Australian citizens by reorganised spy agencies to attack the Coalition government , and then to attack them for the federal police raid on , and threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark of a \u201c tin pot autocracy \u201d .\nLabor was , as usual , playing both sides of the street by also insisting they were on a national security unity ticket .\nBut it clearly established a differentiation on free speech and an open society , and it should now act on it .\nIf that is initially no more than a statement of concern while the other basics get done , well that would be a start .\nBut it should be followed soon , very soon , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its longest-standing and closest ally , of the need to discontinue the prosecution of an Australian citizen for practising the sort of free speech activity that is at the very root of their society , and central to ours .\nThe same representations need to be made to the UK .\nBeyond that , and at the same time , the new independents-Green bloc need to make a joint statement demanding these measures , and that the government press for this .\nAnd we now and soon need a joint statement from former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Rudd , Malcolm Turnbull , Barnaby Joyce , John Hewson , Bob Carr and others \u2014 pressuring the government to take this stance immediately .\nWe need news editors to disregard their right-wing proprietors and lend their shoulders to this push .\nBeyond that , we can \u2019 t let our relief at the change of government release the pressure of the broad public campaign .\nProgressives have lived in a state of political tension for a decade .\nIt is a frequent occurrence that when you get a government that doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily basis , one turns from the public back to the private , safe in the knowledge that there is actual government .\nFair enough on some matters , but don \u2019 t take more than a couple of weeks .\nOn a whole range of matters important to progressives \u2014 Indigenous incarceration , land clearing , school funding , inadequate climate change response , and more \u2014 Labor will be nearly as bad in policy terms as the Coalition .\nWorse , in terms of its ability to act in a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy-clappy bughouse freakshow we \u2019 ve just lived through .\nThat unity ticket includes a denial of their responsibilities to Assange , his rights , and thereby our rights as well .\nAssange \u2019 s health is failing and the shadow of civil death \u2014 endless incarceration \u2014 is upon him , so this matter is of the greatest urgency .\nLabor must act .\nAnd so must we .", "author":

ICAC needs a broad remit", "content": "In his first media conference as opposition leader this week , Peter Dutton made an interesting and welcome comment that passed unnoticed .\nHe opened the way to a wide remit for a federal ICAC .\nAnd he was right to do so .\nClaiming the Coalition supported a federal anti-corruption commission , Dutton said , \u201c The reason I think it \u2019 s more important than ever is that under this Labor government , under the Albanese government , we are going to have a continuation of this unholy alliance with the CFMEU , the ETU , the MUA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICAC should be able to investigate that \u201c unholy alliance \u201d , Dutton believes .\nWith those words , Dutton was effectively proposing a radical expansion of the remit of what the discredited Liberal/News Corp \u201c integrity commission \u201d model would have been able to look at , if Scott Morrison had had his way .\nUnder that model , among many restrictions on what the body could do , it would have been only able to investigate criminal conduct .\nIt was a limitation under which no other anti-corruption body in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICAC , which was destroyed by South Australian parliamentarians .\nBut all other state bodies operate based on a concept of abuse of public office that spans , but isn \u2019 t limited to , criminal conduct , but which includes conduct in breach of professional standards , ethical breaches , codes of conduct , or attempts to improperly influence decision-making .\nThis broader remit reflects the spectrum of corruption .\nEveryone understands \u201c hard corruption \u201d \u2014 brown paper bags stuffed with cash in exchange for approving a property development or buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Australia \u2019 s big problem is soft corruption : \u201c manipulation of policies , institutions and rules of procedure in the allocation of resources and financing by political decision-makers , who abuse their position to sustain their power , status and wealth \u201d , in the words of Transparency International .\nSo extensive has soft corruption been through federal politics that state capture is the only accurate description of policymaking .\nEven stripped of Dutton \u2019 s rhetoric , the \u201c unholy alliance \u201d between unions and the ALP is a classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to manipulate Labor policies through methods such as large-scale donations , and the interchange of personnel ( another classic mechanism of state capture ) .\nOne can argue that unions are at least motivated by the interests of their workers , who are by and large ordinary households .\nThere is often some overlap between the public interest and the trade unions \u2019 interests , but they by no means coincide ( relentless feather-bedding of state-owned transport services , or attempts to dictate education policy by teaching unions , are perfect examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s form of soft corruption , in contrast , involves big business manipulating policies , institutions and rules of procedure in the allocation of resources and financing by Coalition governments , in the interests of shareholders and corporate executives .\nThose interests are frequently diametrically opposed to the public interest : fossil fuel companies driving the climate emergency , big banks gouging customers , gambling companies exploiting addicts , and consulting firms encouraging the degradation of public policymaking .\nSo when Dutton urges a federal ICAC that can investigate the \u201c unholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is urging the remit of such a body be expanded to include soft corruption .\nDutton wants a federal ICAC to look at how donations ( trade unions make massive donations to Labor ) buy policy , how a revolving door between government and the private sector controls policy , and how vested interests override the public interest .\nIf there \u2019 s an unholy alliance between the unions and Labor , then there \u2019 s an equally unholy one between big business and the Coalition \u2014 and we \u2019 ve just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expanded Dutton-esque remit would also include pork-barrelling and rorting of taxpayer funding for political purposes .\nAfter all , that is the manipulation of resource allocation by political decision-makers abusing their position to sustain their power .\nSo Peter Dutton is right : bring on a federal ICAC with a remit to investigate soft corruption .\nLet it examine every unholy alliance , on all sides of politics , every manipulation of public decision-making , every single example

launch so absolutely ?\nFor there isn \u2019 t much doubt that they have .\nLet \u2019 s review .\nThe opposition leader was presented as a man who \u2019 d done hard jobs in the Morrison government , but who was now going to show another side of himself \u2014 \u201c I won \u2019 t change who I am , but you \u2019 re going to see another side of me \u201d , as fawning reports in News and beyond showed him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be to present Dutton as a true conservative , but not as a junkyard dog ; a right-wing alternative to the compromises of Scott Morrison , but ready to reveal some surprising maverick views .\nYeah , that was the problem right there for much of the electorate .\nThe notion that Morrison was , what , a compromiser , \u2019 scuse us ?\nHere we all are thinking that Morrison is an aggressive , literalist Christian , utterly lacking in compassion , willing to spend 10 days dying on Bellevue Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act .\nThe revelation in launching Dutton that there was a conservatism beyond ScoMo was news to a lot of people .\nThe double act got tied up in knots from the start .\nWhen the new Albanese government released the Nadesalingam family back to Biloela , Dutton the family man gave an agitated , aggro response that contradicted the \u201c family man \u201d pitch .\nAfter that outburst , he tacked back to Mr Compassion , apologising for walking out of Parliament during the apology to the Stolen Generations , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ! )\nbecause of climate change .\nHad they been given before he became leader , these might have meant something .\nBut that would be impossible , because a ) he isn \u2019 t sorry for a second , and b ) it would also have damaged Dutton \u2019 s credentials as the \u201c right \u201d candidate .\nBeing given now , they sound craven .\nSo by now Dutton has been the principled conservative against the \u201c woke \u201d , and also the guy who apologises about apologies .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal Party didn \u2019 t need big business , and that he would be turning to small and micro business as a base .\nThe most delicious possibility is that they really believe this propaganda , in defiance of all maths .\nThe hard right \u2014 UAP , One Nation and the Lib Dems \u2014 stood in all 151 seats , and pulled out all stops to do so .\nIts performance was pathetic in all states but Queensland , and there it had big numbers in only firmly held LNP seats .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the right parties gained some impressive numbers , getting up to 15 % of the vote \u2014 but Labor won easily in all of them , and half of their preferences went to Labor .\nWhich suggests a protest vote that was always going to come back to Labor .\nThat is confirmed by the very awkward fact that the Liberals and the commentariat right do not want to acknowledge : the \u201c hard-right \u201d parties are not uniformly so in their policies .\nBoth One Nation and UAP were unashamedly economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and build dams , rail lines , etc , through old-fashioned public-owned projects .\nMoreover , they were also pro-tax .\nPauline Hanson made attacking the zero-tax pay of mining companies one of her key platform points ; the UAP proposed a 15 % \u201c licence \u201d on iron ore , which would be a huge multiple on existing government royalties .\nThat is going directly against the Liberal pitch .\nThe Labor voters who gave their first preferences to those parties were at least in part supporting those policies , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is easily seen in the derisory vote for the Liberal Democrats , who manifestly don \u2019 t believe in tax hikes and public works and who badly trailed other members of the ( haha ) \u201c freedom front \u201d .\nEven AFR hack Aaron Patrick doesn \u2019 t believe there \u2019 s a winning voter stock here .\nDutton and the right are giving out obvious mixed messages as they talk up a fantasy \u201c forgotten people \u201d to provide a majority .\nThese \u201c forgotten people \u201d are working-class and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re also lower-middle-class employers .\nThe belief seems to be that their economic priorities can be disregarded , and that they can be unified and gained on cultural issues .\nAll this seemed to be capped off by an interview with Andrew Bolt on Sky Pravda after dark , which was a bit of a shemozzle .\nBolt spent most of the interview berating him about the apologies , and Dutton \u2019 s pro-forma \u201c wait and see \u201d what the government \u2019 s proposal on the First Nations Voice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t compromise , \u201d Bolt said , \u201c but that \u2019 s just me , I \u2019 m not a politician .\nNow climate change \u2026 \u201d Here it got really weird .\nBolt was asking Dutton to denounce climate change \u201c making children cry \u201d .\nDutton wanted to avoid that , because the party won \u2019 t be going into denialism .\nHe turned the question round to one on teachers and the history curriculum : \u201c I could talk all night about this.\n\u201d People who have picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been another outbreak of a right obsession .\nIt was actually a desperate attempt to have a confrontation with the right-of-right-of-right about climate change .\nThis really is turning into an impressive screw-up .\nDutton is the guy who doesn \u2019 t need big business , but doesn \u2019 t want the woke inner city ; stands up for the average Aussie , but will consider a Voice to Parliament ; is going to be straight-talking , but won \u2019 t give his views on climate change ; is a family man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer being used as anti-refugee hostages .\nHe will never convince a huge number of southerners that he \u2019 s a nice and normal guy .\nBut he might

an agenda for change from someone in the system", "content": "There \u2019 s much to do so I \u2019 ll cut straight to the chase .\nFirstly , I urge you to be a minister for health , not just healthcare .\nThe distinction is important .\nHealth is more than the absence of disease .\nHealthcare is mostly concerned with treating illness .\nIt has little to say about promoting health and avoiding illness unless it involves medical interventions ( part of the problem is how we pay for care\u2026 but we \u2019 ll get to that ) .\nI know everybody \u2019 s over the pandemic .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to experts and work with , not against , the states and territories on containing it .\nWe simply must invest more in promoting health and tackling \u201c upstream \u201d risk factors .\nWe have a pedigree .\nAustralia led the world in reducing tobacco use \u2014 a globally recognised great public health success despite a determined campaign from vested interests .\nWe need strong leadership like that to meet emerging health challenges .\nI \u2019 m sure you know that the most powerful determinants of health ( and disease ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful .\nIt reduces everyone \u2019 s health , not just those at the bottom .\nThe government \u2014 your government \u2014 has the levers controlling many of the factors affecting our health : education , tax , housing , social services and welfare .\nI therefore hope you will promote health in all policies across the relevant portfolios and through the Council of Australian Governments ( COAG ) .\nNow let \u2019 s talk about what we call the health system but which in fact covers mainly medical care .\nTo be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call it a system at all ; it \u2019 s more like patchwork , a marble cake that \u2019 s increasingly struggling to address modern demands .\nSome serious changes are needed to improve how the current arrangements work for patients and consumers as well as those for those who toil every day to deliver care .\nHospitals are expensive and at times dangerous places .\nWe must do everything we can to keep patients out of them , and if not , to ensure that their stay is as short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is difficult under a funding model that rewards activity and I caution against simply throwing more money at public hospitals .\nInflating the balloon won \u2019 t reduce the pressure .\nWhile the states run our public hospitals , the Commonwealth is responsible for primary care .\nRising levels of chronic disease mean that our GPs and allied health professionals are on the frontline in helping people manage their health problems and keep them out of hospital .\nIt also gives them a landing pad after they leave acute care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait times at the front door .\nBut we have a GP shortage in areas of greatest need ( the inverse care law ) .\nMany patients don \u2019 t see their doctor because of high out-of-pocket costs ( bulk billing data is a sham ) .\nLittle wonder that compared to those living in other OECD countries , Australians are almost twice as likely to be admitted for respiratory conditions , most of which should be managed out of hospital .\nYou can help bolster primary care in several ways .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion with our medical colleagues about changing the training , socialisation and culture of medicine to value generalists as highly as specialists .\nBut we also need to increase how much GPs earn .\nAmong OECD countries that provide this data , Australia has the second-lowest GP income rates relative to their specialist colleagues .\nA career in general practice ( a specialisation in its own right ) should be a financially attractive option .\nIf we must have a fee-for-service model , at least we should structure it to reflect various levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incentive to invest the time to help their most vulnerable patients .\nA good start would be to raise the Medicare rebate for general consultations .\nThis should at least begin to improve access for our poorest ( and sickest ) .\nBut at some point , we need to discuss ways to fund care that rewards value , not just volume , in general practice and hospitals .\nPerhaps we could try paying providers a lump sum per patient based on their level of health need ( Gonski for health ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interventions like elective surgery to cover the entire care cycle , from diagnosis to rehab , rather than pay for each individual component as if the patient were a product on an assembly line .\nMost Australians receive elective procedures in the private sector .\n\u201c Private \u201d healthcare in this country is a cosy arrangement between insurers and providers , all propped up by billions courtesy of the taxpayer each year .\nThe truth is that private health diverts resources away from the public sector , rather than taking pressure off it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where those who can afford it get care ( sometimes excessive and unnecessary care ) while those who can \u2019 t go without , languishing on waiting lists .\nLittle wonder the industry is in a death spiral .\nWe can have a private sector , but it must be designed to serve consumers \u2014 not providers and insurers .\nSeveral things can be done .\nStronger regulation on fees and charges , including better transparency and limits .\nAlso , why not publish provider outcomes so that patients can assess the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nPlease do press on with efforts to modernise the Medicare Benefits Schedule , which is full of items that are obsolete or do not reflect effective , high-value care .\nAnd maybe giving more say to health funds in how care is delivered could improve efficiency and value in the private sector .\nFinally , please remember that health isn \u2019 t a commodity , and healthcare is fundamentally different to any other service or product .\nMarket forces can play a role , but relinquishing it all to the invisible hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for worse health outcomes .\nFor evidence , just look at the USA .\nIn fact , you need not look abroad at all .\nAustralian aged care is a prime example of what happens when we leave it to the market with little regulation and oversight .\nIt \u2019 s a complete mess , and a taskforce to implement the Royal Commission findings is needed as soon as possible .\nPerhaps we \u2019 ll leave dental care for another time\u2026 Remember this : \u201c There is nothing more difficult to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dangerous to manage than a new system .\nFor the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institution and merely lukewarm defenders in those who gain by the new ones.\n\u201d Machiavelli said this , and he was

for parliamentarians and staff , established by the Joint Standing Committee on Parliamentary Standards \u2022 Diversity targets and public reporting of diversity characteristics among

in parliamentary chambers ( that includes Question Time ) enforced by presiding officers \u2022 Complaints \u2014 both current and historic \u2014 to be dealt with by the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service .\nParliament \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant other groups were marginalised and vulnerable to misconduct , discrimination , bullying and assault .\nThe 47th Parliament has record numbers of female , Indigenous and independent politicians , with four new First Nations representatives and three new independents .\nWhile it \u2019 s not in newly elected women \u2019 s job descriptions to overhaul parliamentary workplaces , lecturer at the Australian National University ( ANU ) Global Institute for Women \u2019 s Leadership Blair Williams tells Crikey it \u2019 s a good first step .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that itself will result in some changes .\nIt erodes that boys \u2019 club \u2014 especially that Liberal boys \u2019 club \u2014 that we \u2019 ve been seeing in politics for quite a while , \u201d she says .\nDespite this Parliament \u2019 s diversity , she says , more needs to be done : \u201c The Coalition is massively holding [ gender parity ] back \u2014 the level of female representation hasn \u2019 t changed and they need to do something.\n\u201d Parliament is expected to introduce diversity targets and release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will highlight where it \u2019 s falling behind and whether representation extends to staffers .\nAs Gender Policy Fellow at ANU Sonia Palmieri tells Crikey , the new , more diverse Parliament is \u201c a first but really just initial step to cultural change \u201d .\nWhile still a majority government , with fewer politicians representing the two major parties there are hopes the protection racket seen during the Coalition \u2019 s nine-year reign will be disrupted .\nPalmieri believes fewer career politicians , and more independents coming from a wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored as \u201c the norm \u201d won \u2019 t be tolerated .\n\u201c They are coming in from workplaces that don \u2019 t expect to see bullying and harassment as kind of the norm , which is what we have seen for the past two decades , \u201d she says .\n\u201c They \u2019 re coming in from workplaces where accountability is now built-in , so they are the ones who are going to be holding the Parliament to account [ and

culture fuelled by excessive alcohol consumption , and the unpredictability of working hours .\nThe Joint Standing Committee on Parliamentary Standards is set to review working hours , alcohol policies and the code of conduct \u2014 but how well enforced these will be remains to be seen .\n\u201c What we \u2019 d really like to see is a different workplace for members as well , and that really does come down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for things like drinking and workplace dinners and functions , \u201d Palmieri says .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about Parliament accepting that it doesn \u2019 t need to work as this unique workplace because everyone has to fly in and maximise the time that they \u2019 re there .\nWe now have lots of different ways of working as we \u2019 ve understood for the past two years.\n\u201d The election showed Australians were fed up with politicians \u2019 combative approach and were looking for a softer style of leadership .\nExecutive Chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nolan \u2014 who is a former Queensland Labor MP \u2014 believes Albanese \u2019 s leadership style will have a huge impact on the way other MPs behave \u2014 more so , she says , than changing working hours .\n\u201c Just because you \u2019 re working long hours doesn \u2019 t mean there has to be that culture associated with that , \u201d she says .\nAdding a \u201c critical mass \u201d of women , coupled with Albanese \u2019 s leadership style , will make Parliament \u201c a more inclusive and more considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets the tone \u2026 it \u2019 s likely the nature of parliamentary

demoted to opposition spokesman for veterans \u2019 affairs , spent the last days of his leadership rejecting the fact that he is so toxic he helped inflict multiple losses on his Coalition partners .\nAlong the way , he suggested the Coalition \u2019 s fig leaf 2050 emissions target could be dumped .\nNow he \u2019 s undermined newly minted Opposition Leader Peter Dutton \u2014 who claims he \u2019 s all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by opining at length about why a federal ICAC is an affront to democracy .\nWhile Barnaby regressing to his \u201c colour and movement \u201d phase is always entertaining , he has both shone a light on the irredeemable nature of the Nationals and why there \u2019 s a need for more fundamental reform of government spending processes than the new Labor government is prepared to contemplate .\nJoyce \u2019 s argument consists of a Labor MP who lost his seat a quarter of a century ago saying the Hawke government considered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that some members of that cabinet needed a federal ICAC ) , that there was no need for a federal ICAC because there was question time and Insiders , and that politicians should be free to spend money on whatever vision they want .\nYes , Joyce actually claimed that Insiders and a \u201c forensic media gallery \u201d prevent corruption .\nA vacuous program devoted to race-calling by News Corp columnists gets the job done , though presumably you \u2019 d need to redefine corruption as being unable to recall the Wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press gallery as a check on abuse of office .\nAs for the farce of question time being any sort of scrutiny , I reject the premise of your question and in fact , Mr Speaker , the real issue is the corruption of the opposition .\nJoyce also runs a line that is common across political parties : that politicians should be free to spend as they see fit , unfettered by bureaucratic recommendations or \u201c the purity of a business case \u201d , that the elected should be \u201c allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott Morrison peddled this nonsense , the argument is entirely inconsistent with how we \u2019 re governed right now \u2014 we already require experts to do much of the key policymaking in our polity , not politicians , because the latter can \u2019 t be trusted .\nThe Nationals , in particular , can \u2019 t be trusted , because unlike the Liberals , they don \u2019 t even pretend to adhere to the idea that taxpayer money belongs to taxpayers and not governments .\nFor Nationals , the entire point of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it to pork-barrel , rort and look after their mates .\nFor Joyce \u2014 who once boasted ( perhaps perfectly seriously ) that he used Productivity Commission reports as toilet paper \u2014 politicians need to be able to ignore officials and do whatever they like .\nThe interest of taxpayers in seeing their hard-earned money spent wisely by governments is a distant second to what Joyce risibly calls \u201c a vision for a greater Australia \u201d .\nAs we know from the past nine years , \u201c greater Australia \u201d consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations , sports grants based on seat margins , a pointless rail line that will subsidise only wealthy coalminers , advertising contracts handed to mates , land sold for wildly inflated prices to donors , infrastructure projects that state governments don \u2019 t want\u2026 The list goes on and on , as does the cost .\nA problem that Joyce doesn \u2019 t refer to is that if we can \u2019 t trust politicians and need them guarded ferociously , it \u2019 s no longer clear that we can trust the public service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secret power and rigid adherents of \u201c the purity of the business case \u201d , the APS under the Coalition was reduced to bungling servants

visionary politicians .\nInstead it \u2019 s a third-rate bureaucracy and the corrupt politicians who have neutered it .\nThat \u2019 s why a federal ICAC won \u2019 t be anywhere near enough \u2014

will decide who can lose citizenship", "content": "The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments were big on what it means to be Australian , which they demonstrated mainly by removing rights we \u2019 ve tended to assume that , as Australians , we hold .\nThe High Court has not been a bulwark of protection for those rights , mainly because \u2014 as it so often points out \u2014 they mostly don \u2019 t exist .\nHowever , every now and then the top court pushes back , which it has thankfully done by a comforting six-to-one majority in a decision of major importance : whether the Australian government can declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship by acting in a way that demonstrates repudiation of their allegiance to Australia .\nThe answer is no .\nThe relevant law is section 36B of the Australian Citizenship Act , inserted in its current form in 2020 .\nThe act sets out a number of ways in which an Australian citizen can lose citizenship , including voluntarily or , in this case , unintentionally .\nIt \u2019 s most easily explained by the facts of this case .\nDelil Alexander was born in Australia in 1986 , becoming a citizen automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he also acquired Turkish citizenship by descent .\nIn 2013 , Alexander travelled to Turkey and then on to Syria , where according to ASIO he joined the Islamic State and was \u201c likely engaged \u201d in activities of foreign incursion and recruitment for terrorism .\nHe was eventually captured by Kurdish militia , handed to Syrian authorities and imprisoned .\nHe remains detained in a Syrian prison , apparently indefinitely .\nAlexander \u2019 s passport was cancelled and a ministerial order made preventing him from entering Australia .\nIn 2021 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the immigration minister .\nUnder section 36B , the minister then \u201c determined \u201d that he had ceased to be an Australian citizen , on the basis that he had engaged in foreign incursions , which demonstrated a repudiation of his allegiance to Australia .\nThe ministerial power is engaged when the minister makes these factual findings : that the person has done something that is on a list of very bad things ( including foreign incursion ) ; that such actions demonstrate repudiation of their allegiance ; that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain a citizen ; that they wouldn \u2019 t be rendered stateless if their citizenship ceased ( that is , they have dual citizenship ) .\nIt \u2019 s a lot of facts for a minister to find .\nThe act says the minister doesn \u2019 t have to give reasons , and that the rules of natural justice don \u2019 t apply .\nJudge , jury , executioner ?\nWell , yes , said the High Court .\nAlexander \u2019 s lawyers challenged the minister \u2019 s decision on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it offends the constitution .\nThey put it two ways : it was outside the Parliament \u2019 s constitutional power to make this law at all ; or it offends the constitutional principle that the power to adjudge and punish criminal conduct .\nThe first ground failed , the court ruling unanimously that the \u201c aliens \u201d power in the constitution gives the federal Parliament the ability to determine when a person ceases to be a citizen .\nSo that \u2019 s the end of that argument , which has been floating around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there \u2019 s no point arguing with the entire High Court bench ) .\nThe second ground is quite tricky .\nIt \u2019 s old law that the constitution seeks to preserve the separation of powers between the judicial and executive arms of government , by exclusively reserving to the courts certain functions .\nAny attempt by the executive , or by Parliament to allow the executive , to step on the courts \u2019 turf will be invalid .\nThe basic principle here is that the function of deciding whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imposing punishment for it , is one that can only be carried out by a court of law .\nThat is promised so as to ensure that the full protections of our criminal law \u2014 the presumption of innocence , natural justice , prosecutorial burden of proof \u2014 are preserved and nobody can face punishment by arbitrary or capricious determination of the executive .\nIt \u2019 s not that simple , however , because over the years the High Court has allowed a lot of mission creep from the executive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , police can give you an on-the-spot fine for lots of minor offences .\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) can disqualify a person from being a company director , and many other regulatory agencies have powers to fine or otherwise punish miscreants .\nWhere the dividing line is , nobody really knows , which is why the government defended section 36B \u2019 s validity on the basis that it \u2019 s really no worse than ASIC \u2019 s disqualification power .\nIt also said that losing one \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment at all .\nThe court was not buying that .\nIt pointed out that citizenship includes rights .\nIt is \u201c an assurance that [ its holder ] is entitled to be at liberty in this country and to return to it as a safe haven in need .\nThese entitlements are not matters of private concern ; they are matters of public rights of \u2018 fundamental importance \u2019 to the relationship between the individual and the Commonwealth.\n\u201d Wow .\nI wish it had said that before we tried to overturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ve helped .\nLosing your citizenship , the majority said , is analogous to the ancient punishments of exile or banishment .\nAnd those were always regarded as punishment , not merely an administrative act whose purpose is to protect the public , as the government was arguing .\nThe principal purpose of section 36B , the court found , is \u201c retribution for conduct deemed to be so reprehensible as to be incompatible with the shared values of the Australian community \u201d .\nThat \u2019 s consistent with what the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has constantly advanced to justify its desire to strip people of their citizenship .\nIt would be disingenuous to pretend that all the \u201c unAustralian \u201d rhetoric we \u2019 ve been bathed in for the past decade wasn \u2019 t about punishing those who fall short of the dictated standards .\nIt \u2019 s just that that punishment , so far as section 36B is concerned , is by exclusion .\nIt is banishment , nothing less , and it is punitive .\nAnd that is the exclusive turf of the courts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because one of the thousands of rights-denying \u201c national security \u201d laws passed in the past two decades has fallen , and a little bit of due process has been restored .", "author": "Michael Bradley", "url":

come to be called \u201c the 1/6 committee \u201d .\nBroadcast live from 10am AEST today \u2014 8pm Thursday night on the US east coast \u2014 the approximately two-hour hearing provided the emotional valence missing from previous attempts to hold former President Trump accountable , including , most notably , Robert Mueller \u2019 s testimony on his report surrounding Trump \u2019 s first impeachment .\nHumans respond to story , and that \u2019 s what the committee provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visual snippets of his daughter and inner circle testifying , and never-before-seen footage of domestic terror groups executing \u201c stacking , phalanx and flanking manoeuvres \u201d while using the mob as a \u201c force multiplier \u201d .\nNo wonder , coupled with the sheer inadequacy of their numbers , so many capital police officers sustained injuries on the day , a point brought home by the live testimony of officer Carol Edwards , who described her experience of being threatened , overrun , knocked unconscious and tear-gassed \u2014 during which these events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee .\nBehind her , her fellow officers teared up and nodded .\n\u201c What I saw was a war scene

.\nI was catching people as they fell .\nIt was carnage , it was chaos\u2026 \u201d The police were not the only ones struggling for composure .\nAs images flashed on the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aggressive demands by the insurrectionists for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be handed over to them , a collection of elected representatives at the back of the room comforted each other .\nIt was a

officers for rushing into the fight as \u201c we were rushed to safety \u201d .\nBut while it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching shared in the terror , disbelief and fear of those at Capitol Hill that day , its agenda was broader than this .\nFirstly , it seemed designed to establish beyond doubt that the election was not stolen and that former President Trump knew it .\nHe knew it because his senior campaign adviser had told Trump \u201c in pretty blunt terms \u201d soon after the election \u201c that he was going to lose \u201d .\nHe knew it because he lost more than 60 court cases asserting fraud in seven states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told twice by his handpicked attorney-general Bill Barr , shown twice deriding Trump \u2019 s claims of election fraud as \u201c bullshit \u201d and \u201c nonsense \u201d .\nSecondly , the committee showed that Trump , despite knowing it was a lie , kept repeating his stolen election claims to a group of Americans who believed them .\nCue footage of a handful of those awaiting trial or convicted of offences related to the insurrection explaining why they \u2019 d come to Washington and stormed Capitol Hill that day .\n\u201c I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Trump asked for us to come , \u201d said one .\n\u201c I know why I was there because he called me there , and he laid out what was happening to the government .\nHe laid it out , \u201d another claimed .\nSo , what comes next ?\nThe committee has both minimalist and maximalist aims .\nAt a minimum , it needs to turn enough Americans away from the # biglie that it stops being the defining issue of the Republican Party , allowing the nation to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s failed to do for the first time in the country \u2019 s almost 250 years of democracy : transfer power peacefully and move on .\nMaximally , and simultaneously , the committee must show the American people its evidence indicting the former president on two federal charges : obstruction of an official proceeding , and conspiracy to defraud the United States .\nFor Americans like me , who long ago grasped the threat Trump posed to the survival of American democracy , the chance he could escape accountability for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the job \u2014 is an outrage .\nYet at the same time , I understand that the country can not risk the unprecedented step of trying a former president for crimes committed in

for Collaery \u2019 s prosecution to be no-billed , Julian Assange to be returned home and an end to the prosecution of David McBride .\nBut sometimes hypocrisy is useful for more than just the hypocrite .\nWith all the secrecy surrounding successive submarine decisions , what precisely has been achieved ?\nAt least $ 4 billion wasted .\nAllies \u2014 first Japan , then France \u2014 upset

1/6 committee \u201d .\nBroadcast live from 10am AEST today \u2014 8pm Thursday night on the US east coast \u2014 the approximately two-hour hearing provided the emotional valence missing from previous attempts to hold former President Trump accountable , including , most notably , Robert Mueller \u2019 s testimony on his report surrounding Trump \u2019 s first impeachment .\nHumans respond to story , and that \u2019 s what the committee provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visual snippets of his daughter and inner circle testifying , and never-before-seen footage of domestic terror groups executing \u201c stacking , phalanx and flanking manoeuvres \u201d while using the mob as a \u201c force multiplier \u201d .\nNo wonder , coupled with the sheer inadequacy of their numbers , so many capital police officers sustained injuries on the day , a point brought home by the live testimony of officer Carol Edwards , who described her experience of being threatened , overrun , knocked unconscious and tear-gassed \u2014 during which these events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee .\nBehind her , her fellow officers teared up and nodded .\n\u201c What I saw was a war scene \u2026 there were officers on the ground , \u201d Edwards said .\n\u201c They were bleeding and throwing up .\nI saw friends with blood all over their faces .\nI was swimming in people \u2019 s blood .\nI was catching people as they fell .\nIt was carnage , it was chaos\u2026 \u201d The police were not the only ones struggling for composure .\nAs images flashed on the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aggressive demands by the insurrectionists for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be handed over to them , a collection of elected representatives at the back of the room comforted each other .\nIt was a reminder that many of those in the room had lived through that day , or had lost a loved one during or because of it , a sacrifice acknowledged by Republican co-chair Liz Cheney when she thanked the officers for rushing into the fight as \u201c we were rushed to safety \u201d .\nBut while it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching shared in the terror , disbelief and fear of those at Capitol Hill that day , its agenda was broader than this .\nFirstly , it seemed designed to establish beyond doubt that the election was not stolen and that former President Trump knew it .\nHe knew it because his senior campaign adviser had told Trump \u201c in pretty blunt terms \u201d soon after the election \u201c that he was going to lose \u201d .\nHe knew it because he lost more than 60 court cases asserting fraud in seven states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told twice by his handpicked attorney-general Bill Barr , shown twice deriding Trump \u2019 s claims of election fraud as \u201c bullshit \u201d and \u201c nonsense \u201d .\nSecondly , the committee showed that Trump , despite knowing it was a lie , kept repeating his stolen election claims to a group of Americans who believed them .\nCue footage of a handful of those awaiting trial or convicted of offences related to the insurrection explaining why they \u2019 d come to Washington and stormed Capitol Hill that day .\n\u201c I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Trump asked for us to come , \u201d said one .\n\u201c I know why I was there because he called me there , and he laid out what was happening to the government .\nHe laid it out , \u201d another claimed .\nSo , what comes next ?\nThe committee has both minimalist and maximalist aims .\nAt a minimum , it needs to turn enough Americans away from the # biglie that it stops being the defining issue of the Republican Party , allowing the nation to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s failed to do for the first time in the country \u2019 s almost 250 years of democracy : transfer power peacefully and move on .\nMaximally , and simultaneously , the committee must show the American people its evidence indicting the former president on two federal charges : obstruction of an official proceeding , and conspiracy to defraud the United States .\nFor Americans like me , who long ago grasped the threat Trump posed to the survival of American democracy , the chance he could escape accountability for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the job \u2014 is an outrage .\nYet at the same time , I understand that the country can not risk the unprecedented step of trying a former president for crimes committed in office without the tacit

agenda in a massive program that seeks to combine human capital investment , female economic empowerment and election-year priorities .\nToday \u2019 s NSW budget from Treasurer Matt Kean combines additional spending fuelled by extra revenue with an intergenerational agenda that elevates female economic participation as the key driver to achieve fiscal sustainability over coming decades , while also offering short-term cost-of-living relief and the beginnings of tax reform .\nTucked away in the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the long-term agenda of the government : In contrast to the federal Coalition \u2019 s final budget , which refused to address a comparable fiscal gap in Commonwealth finances , Kean wants to address this by driving increased female participation .\nWith a goal of making substantial progress towards closing the difference between male and female participation over the next decade , Kean \u2019 s budget has a long list of major and minor investment initiatives , some already announced , such as $ 3.7 billion in childcare and preschool funding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the decade .\nNSW will also provide two weeks \u2019 additional paid parental leave for NSW public servants with no distinction between primary and secondary carers , to encourage men to share more of the early childcare load , more support for women to return to work after extended time out of the workforce , more funding for female entrepreneurs , and fertility treatment leave for public sector workers .\nBut the NSW government will be one of the biggest drivers of female employment itself , with big increases in spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education sectors .\nThe 3 % pay rises in the next two years for public sector workers will be well below inflation ( but significantly above previous public sector pay caps ) and the $ 3000 bonus to healthcare workers will flow primarily to female workers \u2014 while its commitment of billions to expand the NSW health workforce by 13,000 , with a particular focus on regional health services , will also go mainly to female health professionals .\nHundreds of millions in funding to recruit and retain childcare and early childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates that between 26,000 and 95,000 NSW women are either entering the workforce beyond current predictions or moving from part-time to full-time employment .\nBy design or coincidence , it builds on one of the few positive legacies of Scott Morrison \u2019 s time in federal politics : the substantial increase in female participation driven by increased healthcare funding from 2015 onwards .\nThe glossies that usually accompany budgets are mainly vehicles for government spin , but the \u201c women \u2019 s opportunity statement \u201d accompanying this budget , the product of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier this year , is a long , detailed and almost academic document identifying the causes of lower female participation , lower superannuation , the gender pay gap and particular disincentives faced by Indigenous women , women with disabilities and those from diverse communities \u2014 and the logic of how the government is responding .\nIts agenda is to increase participation , support women in small business , curb workplace harassment and domestic violence , improve pay and remove gender gaps in the workforce and invest more in women \u2019 s health needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Kean and the NSW Liberals do best : marry good policy with good politics .\nAfter the defeat of a federal Coalition government partly due to the federal Liberals \u2019 complete lack of

referred to as a \u201c megadrought \u201d , can be largely attributed to lower rainfall .\nThe deficit is driven by natural variability in rainfall patterns , ocean dynamics in the tropical Pacific , and .\nCollectively , these phenomena have dried out soil , reduced stream flow , and created snow droughts .\nIt has prompted a major decline in surface and groundwater resources , economic losses , ecosystem disruptions , and an increased risk of wildfires .\nFrom January 2020 to August 2021 , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico and Utah ) experienced the lowest total precipitation and the third-highest daily average temperatures recorded since 1895 .\nThe weather pattern continued into 2022 and prompted governors in each of the six states to issue drought emergency declarations .\nThe federal government issued an , ordering water restrictions along the Colorado River , a major source of water for agriculture and cities in the region .\nThe frequency and intensity of such droughts , and their cross-cutting and compound effects , are as a result of climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water agencies across the southwest have developed new water-management strategies to enhance local drought resilience .\nAt the local level , such efforts are frequently nested within a complex inter- and intrastate institutional framework in which surface water supplies ( as opposed to groundwater ) are governed using an \u201c appropriation \u201d .\nAdministered by state-level agencies , the allocation of finite surface water flows is complicated by the diversity of competing stakeholders \u2014 social , economic and environmental \u2014 in dry times .\nWater-management decisions at the local level may be hindered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and .\nDespite the challenges imposed by drought and the region \u2019 s Byzantine water policy structure , many of the southwest \u2019 s largest and fastest-growing cities have been able to adapt and increase their drought resilience .\nWater has been conserved through both regulation and incentive-based programmes that focus on increasing the installation of water-saving technologies and transformation of urban landscapes from water-dependent turf lawns to drought-tolerant vegetation .\nResidents and businesses located in San Diego , California , for example , have access to a variety of programmes and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority ( SDCWA ) .\nA wholesale water supplier , the SDCWA serves the city along with 23 other municipalities and water agencies located within San Diego County .\nThe SDCWA \u2019 s initiative includes various rebates and educational resources to subsidise a portion of the costs to residents and businesses that invest in more water-efficient technology and landscapes .\nIn other regions , policymakers have taken a more heavy-handed approach to reduce the use of water-intensive turf lawns .\nIn 2021 , amid the region \u2019 s most recent drought emergency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEfforts to reduce urban water use have been coupled with initiatives to enhance water supply diversification .\nThe city of Phoenix , the in the US , largely relies upon water pumped across state lines from the Colorado River .\nHowever , the city also receives water in-state from the Salt and Verde rivers via the Salt River Project , which are generally less constrained than the Colorado River , as well as a small portion of water drawn from local groundwater reserves .\nIn 2003 , the SDCWA took an innovative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a with the Imperial Irrigation District , which provides water for irrigation to farmland located in southern California \u2019 s Imperial Valley .\nThe SDCWA agreed to fund irrigation improvements for the District and lease the resulting water savings .\nWith funding assistance from the state government , the SDWCA also lined two transfer channels to reduce water loss caused by seepage .\nMore recently , the city of San Diego and the SDCWA have also invested in water-pipe-monitoring technology to detect and repair leaks in the municipality \u2019 s water distribution system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego County opened the nation \u2019 s largest .\nThe SDCWA entered a that will meet approximately 10 % of San Diego \u2019 s water needs .\nWater recycling has also played an increasing role in local efforts to increase water supply diversification .\nIn 2019 , Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti pledged to recycle 100 % of the city \u2019 s wastewater by 2035 .\nIn Las Vegas , the Southern Nevada Water Authority captures and treats from indoor use , putting it into Lake Mead , which provides about .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves .\nThe city of Phoenix , delivering it for uses in agriculture , energy production , urban irrigation , groundwater replenishment and river ecosystem maintenance .\nIn San Diego , recycle approximately of the city \u2019 s wastewater for non-drinking uses such as irrigation and manufacturing .\nAnd in 2021 , the city launched the Pure Water San Diego initiative that includes constructing two new plants to treat wastewater to meet drinking water standards .\nThe multi-year program aims to provide more than 40 % of the city \u2019 s local water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southwest \u2019 s persistent drought conditions , cities have undertaken multi-pronged approaches to enhance drought resilience .\nIn some of the most arid locations , these efforts have been fruitful .\nFrom 2002 to 2020 , per capita water consumption in the SNWA service area , while the region \u2019 s population increased by approximately 52 % .\nWithin the complex structure of western water policy , long-term , collaborative initiatives that span the public and private sectors and various levels of governance have led to this achievement .\nHowever , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions remain concerning long-term sustainability considering the expected droughts to come and their short- and long-term effects on rural communities and the natural environment .",

and that late-term abortions are common .\nThere are a number of harmful lies peddled by these anti-women groups , both in the US and in Australia .\nHere are the facts .\nAbortions are medically necessary health interventions .\nUp to one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage before 20 weeks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , often before a woman knows she is pregnant ) .\nMore than 50 % of all women who miscarry require medical intervention consisting of medication to speed up the miscarriage or a procedure that prevents infection by cutting out pregnancy tissue that remains in the uterus .\nThis is crucial during a missed miscarriage \u2014 where the pregnancy has stopped growing but hasn \u2019 t passed .\nUnplanned pregnancies are not the only reason to seek an abortion .\nIt can be due to contraception failure \u2014 no contraception is 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not every woman can access or use contraceptives .\nIt can be due to violence , rape or intimate partner violence .\nWomen may seek abortions due to foetal anomalies , or illness during pregnancy .\nPregnancy carries a number of risks .\nIn Australia , one in 100 women experiences severe complications with their pregnancies .\nAustralia has one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world at 6.7 deaths per 100,000 women giving birth , and terminating dangerous pregnancies attributes to this low death rate .\nThere are major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be denied healthcare , such as chemotherapy , if they are pregnant , prioritising the foetus \u2019 survival over the woman \u2019 s .\nMedical abortions \u2014 taking two pills to stop a pregnancy \u2014 can be used up to nine weeks \u2019 gestation in Australia .\nThe pills are low-risk , available via Telehealth and the preferred method if the pregnancy is noticed in time .\nSince 2001 , surgical abortions halved in Australia , largely thanks to the introduction of medical abortion in 2006 and adding these medications to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have to be prescribed the medication at just eight weeks \u2019 gestation \u2014 that \u2019 s before many women realise they \u2019 re pregnant .\nOf the 88,000 abortions that took place in Australia between 2017 and 2018 , almost 21,000 were medical .\nMost abortions in Australia take place during the first trimester of pregnancy , and late-term abortions are rare .\nMost abortions that take place after 20 weeks are due to the foetus being diagnosed with a severe abnormality , which can only be diagnosed at the 19-week mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million unsafe abortions take place every year , killing nearly 50,000 women .\nWorldwide , 48 % of all induced abortions are unsafe , accounting for an estimated 13 % of maternal deaths .\nAbout one in five pregnancies end in induced abortions .\nAbortions occur at more than double the rate in low-income countries than in high-income countries due to the affordability and availability of contraception .\nIn high-income countries , including Australia , the abortion rate is 15 per 1000 women .\nAbout one in six women in Australia and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-30s .\nWhile women in their 20s and single were more likely to have an abortion , women with

about how Scott Morrison funded faith groups", "content": "Just a quick note to pass on the appreciation of countless people who ( I am told ) are celebrating the church rehabilitation industry \u2019 s coming demise .\nThose are the precise words one of my closest sources used after hearing that you had called for an urgent briefing on how and why the Morrison government funded the Pentecostal-linked Esther Foundation and the one80TC rehab facility which has very close ties to Hillsong church .\nIt will indeed be interesting to see how the Morrison government \u2019 s processes worked and what it tells us about the integrity \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensed public money through the Health Department .\nAnd what of the role of bureaucrats ?\nSports rorts we know about .\nRehab rorts ?\nThat \u2019 s a whole other chapter .\nI know you are calling for information from your department but there are some things they might not be aware of , which is why I am writing .\nI only found out these things after our stories were published last week .\nThe new information might just give you the ammunition to ask : what role did the Morrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 million in taxpayers funds to the one80TC rehab facility ?\nAnd how in heaven \u2019 s name did the Australian taxpayer ever get dragooned into paying for it ?\nAnd how did one80TC \u2019 s activities ever get called rehab ?\nIn my stories last week I danced around the question of how closely the one80TC rehab facility was tied to Hillsong Church .\nJacob Harrison , who spoke to us for our stories , called one80TC \u201c a Hillsong indoctrination centre with a mild interest in rehab \u201c .\n( Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a psychiatric ward and found himself washing Brian Houston \u2019 s car as a \u201c volunteer \u201d . )\nFrankly I didn \u2019 t appreciate how right he was .\nAnother source has since pointed me in the right direction .\nIt emerges that the Hillsong Foundation ( which supports the church \u2019 s outreach works in Australia and overseas \u2014 in Africa , for example ) donates about $ 300,00 to $ 400,000 a year to one80TC .\nAccording to the source it is a \u201c feature recipient \u201d every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Appeal , held each June to drum up donations .\nMost interesting is a report which gives the metrics on Hillsong \u2019 s donation to one80TC , which it describes as a \u201c Christ-centred organisation \u201d which is \u201c more than just a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program \u201d .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been an exciting year for one80TC , with 80 salvations , 37 baptisms in 2022 alone , and eight of our ex-one80TC students choosing to stay on for our graduate program , where they volunteer with the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d it says .\nEighty \u201c salvations \u201d and 37 baptisms ?\nAnd we are not even halfway through the year .\nAs my source points out , Hillsong records these numbers as if the success of the rehab program is based on whether or not you become a Christian .\nEssentially , my Hillsong source says , it means the church is \u201c buying \u201d conversions by taking advantage of people at their most vulnerable .\n( Their words , not mine . )\nThe one80TC coffee lounge , held after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Hills campus , is apparently run purely by volunteers and is the only time and place where the \u201c inmates \u201d are allowed to see their families .\nSo basically , my source concludes , the families of one80TC rehab residents are also being forced to attend Hillsong Church so they can also be \u201c brainwashed \u201d .\nI know also that one80TC is signed up to the idea that the most common underlying cause of addiction is childhood trauma which , they say , includes abuse and \u201c fatherlessness \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority on fatherlessness ( rarely talked about in Australia , the facility says ) and cites his paper , \u201c The Facts on Fatherlessness \u201d , which he prepared for the Fatherhood Foundation of the Australian Family Association in 2002 .\nMuehlenberg is a conservative evangelical writer with a large following .\nAccording to the Christian news site Eternity News he is \u201c concerned with the shift in culture away from the traditional family , as well as loss of freedom of speech , and the rise of the progressive left \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , he places his hope in revival , \u201d the site reported when he was cancelled by Facebook .\nIf you peel back the layers you find , too , that the Australian Family Association is a creature of the socially conservative National Civic Council , established by BA Santamaria .\n( But you probably knew that . )\nMinister , this is not the kind of intel you might get from departmental officials who , I suggest , are not likely to have ever set foot inside one80TC or Hillsong Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : what is the rationale for giving public money to a rehab facility which measures its success by the number of souls it saves for Christ ?\nDid Scott Morrison or any other government member hijack the grants assessment process ?\nTo what end ?\nLooking

rate of benefits , which left years and decades without a catch-up , has always been a scandal .\nNow it \u2019 s a social disaster of major proportions .\nBut because it is happening slowly , it is

contraception is still a postcode lottery across Australia .\nThe contraceptive pill can be just a few dollars a month , while long-acting reversible contraception ( LARC ) , such as an IUD , costs

.\nWhy is there such a variation in cost ?\nContraception pills and devices , along with PlanB and the abortion pill RU486 , are covered by Medicare , but there are still out-of-pocket costs .\nMedicare rebates cover less than half the cost of an IUD insertion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover pain relief for the invasive procedure .\nWhile some clinics act as one-stop shops \u2014 where a GP is

of women aged 15-44 were using a LARC .\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic , Australia faced shortages of many common versions of the contraception pill .\nMarie Stopes Australia head of policy Bonney

Australia , Queensland and Tasmania have public access to abortions , in NSW they can only take place in a private clinic costing upward of $ 470 or through Family Planning NSW at $ 165 with Medicare .\nWhat about the variation in access ?\nWomen in regional or rural areas , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t access Medicare due to their visa status all face

allow women to fully exercise their rights to reproductive autonomy , \u201d she said .\nThose in rural areas may struggle to access a GP who is willing to prescribe contraception or find practitioners who are trained in IUD insertion services .\nWomen who speak languages other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to access services that are culturally appropriate , and women with disabilities struggle to access sexual reproductive services to meet their needs because of stigma and misguided presumptions of their sexual reproductive health needs .\nIn Victoria , there are no medical abortion prescribers in 12 local government areas , while last year leading national abortion provider Marie Stopes closed several clinics across regional Queensland and NSW due to lack of funding

health services accessible for all Australians .\nBut there are two things that need to be prioritised , Corbin said : funding and GP appointments .\nA current bulk-bill standard consult is just 10 minutes long , and with no current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many women aren \u2019 t given an opportunity to discuss their options .\n\u201c Some GPs may find it easier to prescribe the pill than go through the process of prescribing an IUD , particularly when an IUD is costly and in some situations requires ongoing referrals , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Most states and territories don \u2019 t fund pregnancy choices counselling within their health system \u2026 so a lot of counselling is done by NGOs and private clinics.\n\u201d Corbin hopes some funding in the strategy will be prioritised for @ @ @ @ @ @

abortion is illegal , the pills after often used even later \u2014 in self-managed medication abortions between 13 to 24 weeks of pregnancy , the pills worked successfully in 76 % of cases , with others needing medical intervention to remove the remaining pregnancy tissue .\nSydney University Gynaecology and Neonatology clinical associate professor Dr Deborah Bateson tells Crikey extending the guidelines to 12 weeks would increase access , with women able to pass a pregnancy in the comfort and convenience of their own home .\nWhile using medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific advice and guidelines , and will mean extra bleeding and tissue needing to be passed , Bateson said it would also provide women with a greater degree of control .\n\u201c It \u2019 s that feeling of being in control of the process rather than being medicalised , \u201d she said , adding surgical abortions should always be an option .\nThe extra policing of the pills as an authority script \u2014 requiring a third-party sign-off before the prescription is valid \u2014 is an example of over-policing , she said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispense the pills .\nGPs have to undergo a training course that takes between three and fours hours in order to be registered to prescribe the pills .\nThey also have to reregister every three years .\nBetween 2020 and 2021 there were just 3018 active registered prescribers in Australia \u2014 in some regions , this equates to one registered prescriber per 3369 women of childbearing age .\nIt \u2019 s a similar story for pharmacists , with just 5556 active registered dispensers across the country .\nThis creates barriers and reinforces stigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though telehealth has improved access ) .\n\u201c It should be just part of a mainstream drug policies and we shouldn \u2019 t have to have that authority , \u201d Bateson said .\nUpping the number of registered prescribers was equally problematic .\nWhile a small number of GPs may refuse to prescribe the abortion pill on conscientious grounds , misinformation about their obligations held others back .\nOne study found that GPs felt medical abortions were out of the scope of their practice or could create stigma , or that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day in case of complications .\nBateson said another challenge , especially for GPs in regional and remote areas , was ensuring there was a pathway to surgical abortion or access to a public hospital in case a registered prescriber felt the abortion pill wasn \u2019 t appropriate .\nMifepristone has been highly politicised in Australia .\nIts availability was blocked from 1996 to 2006 following an amendment by anti-abortionist senator Brian Harradine to the Therapeutic Goods Act .\nBacked by then prime minister John Howard in exchange for Harradine \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amendment made it so the drug could only be imported with written ministerial approval .\nNo other drug in Australia has ever been given this treatment , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at James Cook University Caroline May de Costa tells Crikey .\nShe was a key driver in getting restrictions around the drug lifted .\n\u201c It was a completely special thing , and the fact that it was abortion was considered to be the justification for this , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Australian women didn \u2019 t really know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if it was ever discussed in the media , it was confused with the emergency contraception.\n\u201d May de Costa has been performing surgical abortions across her career ( even smuggling IUDs into Dublin ) and knew the importance of Mifepristone .\nIn 2005 she published a paper in the Medical Journal of Australia on the safety , efficacy and necessity of Mifepristone which received political support , starting a conversation around reproductive rights .\nWhile Harradine \u2019 s amendment was overturned in 2006 , getting the pill into Australia was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face off against Abbott and import the pill from France , as New Zealand had been doing .\nMay de Costa found a legal loophole allowing doctors in private practices to import the pill in Queensland .\n\u201c For two years , [ another doctor ] and I were the only doctors who had the permission of the TGA to provide abortion pills \u2026 we got a fair bit of attention but it was perfectly safe , \u201d she said .\nIn 2009 abortion provider Maire Stopes was able to get Mifepristone approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies found it was safe and effective , it became fully licensed in 2013 and listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme the year after .\nA long way to go Both Bateman and May de Costa believe abortions should be fully implemented into public practice \u2014 in states such as NSW patients have to go to a private or specialised clinic \u2014 and make the pill more readily available to 12 weeks gestation .\nBut changing TGA guidelines is an arduous and expensive process .\nWith just one Australian manufacturer of the pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in an application to have the process changed .\n\u201c Things have gotten much better , \u201d May de Costa said .\n\u201c But we need to have abortion destigmatised and in the public system , as part of mainstream women \u2019 s reproductive health care .\n\u201d", "author": "Amber Schultz", "url":

streets over a fight for better classroom conditions last week , Peter Dutton was setting his sights on a different kind of battle over education .\nThe new opposition leader recently emphasised the

the usual Liberal Party enemies ; it \u2019 s inspired by the success of his international political counterparts at reframing education as a conservative-favouring issue .\nLast month , Crikey reported on how Dutton \u2019 s signposting about education as a political battleground in one of his first interviews as opposition leader seemed to draw inspiration from the United States .\nIn recent years , state and local Republicans have capitalised and encouraged confected fears about critical race theory or gender theory in curricula to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught to their children .\nIn an attempt to avoid an unfavourable comparison to the book burning of the 1970s and the obvious hypocrisy of the so-called \u201c party of free speech \u201d policing what \u2019 s taught in Year 4 classrooms , Republicans are branding it as an issue of \u201c parents \u2019 choice \u201d \u2014 a messaging sleight-of-hand that Dutton has also adopted .\nExcept it \u2019 s really about less choice around what children can be taught in Australian schools .\nDutton wants to crack down on \u201c non-core curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in hand with choice .\nNor is it about parents : as Liberal Senator Hollie Hughes recently said , the future of the Liberal Party depends on \u201c fixing \u201d the education system .\nHughes really gave the game away when she told an audience at the conservative think tank the Sydney Institute that youth voters are abandoning the Coalition because of \u201c Marxist \u201d teachers who are teaching them \u201c absolute leftwing rubbish \u201d .\nIn Hughes \u2019 eyes , the actual problem with the education system is that not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote for the Liberal Party .\nIt \u2019 s also important to look at what Dutton , Hughes and the rest of the party don \u2019 t say about education .\nThey want to talk about the national curriculum .\nThey want to talk about protecting schools \u2019 values ( presumably a reference to the debate over our religious discrimination bill and its impact on schools ) .\nThe education debate , by their telling , is being fought over the culture that they \u2019 re being taught about .\nThey

\u2018wrongheaded\u2019 federal ICAC powers proposed by teal independent Kylea Tink", "content": "Australia \u2019 s first anti-corruption commissioner , Ian Temby QC , has panned a proposal to give a federal integrity commission the power to sack parliamentarians .\nTemby , who was appointed founding commissioner of the NSW ICAC , told Crikey the idea floated by newly elected \u201c teal \u201d independent Kylea Tink was \u201c wrongheaded \u201d .\nTink defeated Liberal Trent Zimmerman for the seat of North Sydney , and has argued for the introduction of a code of conduct that would have consequences for MPs , suggesting that a new integrity commission could have the power to sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is wrongheaded on more than one level .\nFirstly , it \u2019 s not the case that the NSW ICAC has sacked any member of Parliament , although it \u2019 s commonly contended that it sacked three premiers , \u201d Temby told Crikey .\n\u201c Of course each of them chose to resign.\n\u201d \u201c It should never be the function of such a body to sack anybody .\nWhat should happen in relation to members of Parliament or ministers or judges or anybody who holds office subject to dismissal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted if the allegations are sufficiently serious .\nFindings will then be made concerning the conduct in question .\nAnd those findings should go to the Parliament for the Parliament to decide what action , if any , should be taken .\n\u201c It must always be for those who hold the power and responsibility to take that action .\nAnd that \u2019 s how it \u2019 s been .\nAnd it \u2019 s how it should continue to be.\n\u201d Tink \u2019 s office said she had no further comment and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust conversations \u201d about the federal integrity commission .\nTemby \u2019 s comments mark his first intervention in the debate over the mooted federal integrity commission , with the Albanese government promising to introduce legislation for the body by the end of the year .\nTemby served as head of the NSW ICAC from 1989 to 1994 .\nHe told Crikey that a new federal body \u201c could do a lot worse \u201d than use the NSW body as a model , although he added that NSW was not a perfect model .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the NSW legislation is more complex than it ought sensibly to be , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The essential characteristics for such a body are that it has all royal commission powers , that it can commence its own investigations , whether on complaint or otherwise , that it must investigate anything which is referred to it by the Parliament and that it should report to the Parliament and not to the executive .\nIt should have the power to examine matters retrospectively , not simply in relation to future allegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 ll be ineffective and a piece of window dressing.\n\u201d On the contentious question of public hearings , Temby said it was \u201c very important \u201d that the body should have the power to do so provided it was a case of real significance and \u201c judged by the commission \u201d to be in the public interest .\n\u201c The courts don \u2019 t hold hearings in public because they think it \u2019 s fun to do so .\nThey do so because they \u2019 re performing a public function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be held to account and closely examined for their conduct in conducting hearings .\nAnd it \u2019 s only by doing it in public that they can be held properly accountable .\nThat \u2019 s one strong argument in favour of public hearings , \u201d he said .\nHolding public hearings had also built \u201c a strong degree of public confidence \u201d in NSW and was a key reason why the NSW ICAC had continued for more than 30 years .\nIn terms of specific areas , Temby nominated the multibillion-dollar defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Experience tells us that whenever there \u2019 s a lot of money involved , and that money is moving around , then some people will sometimes fail to resist the temptation to grab a bit for themselves .\nAnd to my mind , it \u2019 s highly improbable that there has not been any corrupt conduct in relation to , for example , defence procurement over the years .\nI don \u2019 t know that that \u2019 s happened , but it seems to me to be highly improbable , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might be corrupt , though it would depend on how it was defined in the legislation .\n\u201c It will depend upon circumstances .\nSometimes it may be if the conduct is sufficiently crass and obviously unjustified in the public interest , \u201d he said .\nIan Temby \u2019 s ICAC famously bit its creator when the commission found that then premier Nick Greiner had engaged in corrupt conduct when he found a public service job for a political adversary , former Liberal MP turned independent Terry Metherell .\nAs reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later overturned by the NSW Court of Appeal \u2014 a decision that \u201c knocked the stuffing \u201d out of Temby , he wrote in his memoir .\nTemby \u2019 s memoir also reportedly records his \u201c wistful \u201d observation that Greiner \u201c remains very bitter towards me to this day \u201d .\nNow retired from the bar , Temby had put Greiner in the political furnace before , during and after his tenure at the ICAC .\nAs the first Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) , appointed by then Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court judge ( and Labor appointee ) Lionel Murphy for attempting to pervert the course of justice .\nAs DPP , it also fell to him to pick up on extraordinary allegations from the Costigan royal commission that Kerry Packer \u2014 codenamed \u201c The Goanna \u201d \u2014 was inter alia involved in drug trafficking and murder .\nGiven a lack of evidence no prosecution ensued .", "author": "David Hardaker", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/07/05/ian-temby-pans-proposed-federal-icac-powers-kylea-tink/", "published": "Mon, 04 Jul 2022

happens if you put an entertainer into political office ?\nPolitics , after all , is famously showbusiness for ugly people .\nRonald Reagan never stopped being a performer , transforming effortlessly

the military-industrial complex .\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy , literally actor-turned-politician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a legitimate political wartime leadership style .\nDonald Trump , the demon spawn of the satanic ( and not in a good way ) genre of reality television , exploited his showbusiness skills in service of a nihilistic agenda of destruction and rage .\nAnd then there \u2019 s Boris Johnson , who has never been anything more than an entertainer .\nA serial fabulist in life , his \u201c journalism \u201d was a litany of invented stories , his \u201c literature \u201d a glib facsimile of

that other politicians are .\nHe \u2019 s just pretending to be PM \u2014 you \u2019 re not taking him seriously , surely ?\nLike Osborne \u2019 s Archie Rice , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there \u2019 s nothing behind the eyes of Johnson .\nNo substance , no agenda , no goals .\nOn this he \u2019 s closer to Scott Morrison , another leader from the entertainment industry ( marketing \u2014 aka show business for sociologists ) , than Donald Trump .\nTrump incarnates a destructive white male rage against the fact that it \u2019 s no longer 1861 .\nJohnson incarnates a chap who thinks it \u2019 d be a jolly wheeze to be Prime Minister as long as it doesn \u2019 t stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Guide to England books ( as Dominic Cummings revealed , Johnson complained about having to do his job , like visiting flood victims , when he just wanted to sit at No .\n10 writing his Shakespeare book ) .\nThis makes the urgings by right-wing UK media outlets to \u201c let Boris be Boris \u201d \u2014 which have cropped up routinely during various crises in his prime ministership \u2014 particularly silly .\nThere is no inner Boris being stifled by bureaucrats/advisers/the Tory party , because there is no inner Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re ever going to get .\nAs Australians discovered with Morrison , entertainers make poor leaders .\nThe lack of substance and the obsession with image leads to governing by announcement and media release , while the actual skills required to govern competently are left to wither .\nAnd the lack of substance leads to an inability to understand what is genuinely important .\nThe spark for the latest crisis to beset Johnson \u2014 the resignations of his chancellor and health minister , along with a slew of parliamentary secretaries and party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scandal of his now-former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher , who is accused by a number of men of being a long-term serial sexual harasser and predator .\nJohnson insisted he knew nothing about allegations against Pincher , only for the former head of the Foreign Office to emerge and explain that Johnson was personally briefed about Pincher \u2019 s assaults while in the Foreign Office .\nJust as inevitably , Johnson is now said to have referred to Pincher with the phrase \u201c Pincher by name , pincher by nature.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ritual : the initial insistence of innocence , the exposure of the lie , the attempts to explain away the lie , the revelation of some grubby or glib dismissal of the issue by a man unable to determine whether writing his lightweight addition to the Shakespeare library or visiting flood victims is more important .\nWith a solid chunk of his backbench having already pushed for his departure , and a continuing stream of ministerial defections , it \u2019 s clear even his own party understands that Johnson is an agenda-less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat in 2024 .\nA man who is dead behind the eyes will soon be dead politically .\nWhether

Morrison \u2019 s nonsensical 2050 net-zero target , and it \u2019 s every bit as political .\nLabor can rightly insist it took 43 % to the election and won , but any talk of a mandate is undercut by

.\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware , from the Gillard era , of what happens when it appears to break election promises in relation to climate action .\nThe government also wants to paint itself as the

government wants to portray as irrational zealots .\nThus the invocation of 2009 by Anthony Albanese , aided and abetted by the press gallery , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greens should have voted for Kevin Rudd \u2019 s hopelessly compromised carbon pollution reduction scheme ( CPRS ) , thus avoiding a lost decade on climate .\nBut that \u2019 s the stuff of political science fiction \u2014 it

who can only complain about Labor \u2019 s take-it-or-leave-it approach .\nBut whether the target is 43 % or 50 % or higher is less important than the fact that the government has no intention of resiling from approving new coal and gas projects \u2014 so that we can continue to generate colossal revenues from fossil fuel exports .\nGas projects like Woodside \u2019 s Scarborough gas field , and what will likely be the world \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barossa project in the Northern Territory , will add billions of tonnes of carbon emissions over coming decades .\nThe government also has

deserving far more coverage than the 43 % debate \u2014 especially considering taxpayers get next to nothing in tax revenue from fossil fuel companies selling gas overseas .\nIt also points to the

Jim Chalmers should declare it", "content": "After promising to introduce a federal integrity commission and getting elected on a platform which included restoring good governance , Anthony Albanese is quite rightly taking a hard line on ministers when it comes to owning shares in public companies .\n\u201c Ministers will not have any direct shareholdings .\nMinisters are required to divest themselves of shareholdings , except in superannuation and other broadly diversified managed funds .\nThere will be no \u2018 blind trust \u2019 arrangements , \u201d the prime minister \u2019 s code of conduct says , even reaching down to humble assistant ministers .\nSo what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multimillion-dollar stake in the $ 14 billion ASX-listed bancassurance outfit Suncorp which controversially proposes selling its banking division to rival ANZ for $ 4.9 billion \u2014 undermining competition and further entrenching the power of Australia \u2019 s big four banks .\nFirst up , federal Treasurer and proud Queenslander Jim Chalmers needs to get this conflict of interest on the record and disclose how it will be managed .\nWhen it comes to governance and transparency , Labor \u2019 s Queensland division is not exactly a star performer .\nFor instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio through its Labor Holdings-associated entity , as Crikey explained in January , pointing out that the party had a $ 10 million stake in CSL at the same time as the debate about vaccine subsidies and government contracts was raging .\nThe CSL share register reveals that \u201c Labor Holdings Pty Ltd \u201d pops up in the top 150 , with 37,700 shares ( now worth $ 11.2 million ) registered with stockbroker \u201c Morgans WealthPlus \u201d in Brisbane .\nAs I wrote in 2008 in The Sunday Age , the ALP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 1986 when it sold radio station 4KQ .\nThe proceeds were put into the sharemarket and by 2007 its biggest stake was 1.18 million Suncorp shares which , if held today , would be worth $ 14 million .\nUnfortunately , Labor Holdings stopped disclosing individual dividend payments to the AEC in 2015 , as you can see from this pathetic effort in 2019-20 .\nBy way of comparison , the Victorian Liberals have arguable control over an estimated $ 90 million share portfolio housed in the Cormack Foundation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party sold Melbourne radio station 3XY for about $ 16 million in the late 1980s .\nCormack \u2019 s largest investment is about 266,000 Commonwealth Bank shares which are currently worth $ 25 million .\nWe know about this whopping Liberal Party equity play with CBA because the Cormack Foundation does disclose its individual dividend payments to the AEC , as you can see here , rather than hiding everything behind stockbroker Morgans , as Queensland Labor does .\nBack in 2014-15 , Labor Holdings disclosed to the AEC that it generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , $ 908,240 of which came from Suncorp Metway in two separate payments of $ 593,600 and $ 314,640 .\nWhy does this matter ?\nWell , Bernard Keane and Glenn Dyer argued in Crikey yesterday that ANZ \u2019 s Suncorp banking purchase should be blocked by either the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or Chalmers .\nFrankly , it \u2019 s hard to see this happening .\nWhen it comes to banking , Suncorp is a bit of a one-state wonder unlike its genuinely national insurance business which operates non-Queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New ACCC boss Gina Cass-Gottlieb will certainly come under pressure to block the deal on competition grounds and the parochial Queensland government also has blocking power .\nThis explains the over-the- top talk of Olympic and green energy funding in yesterday \u2019 s main ANZ announcement , plus the promise to not close any Queensland Suncorp branches for three years and retain net staff numbers .\nIt might not be a great time to be a teller in ANZ \u2019 s Queensland branch network \u2014 although this wasn \u2019 t mentioned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by Suncorp yesterday .\nAnother disappointing regulatory aspect is that neither set of shareholders get to vote .\nIf Suncorp wants to cash out of 30 % of its assets then surely shareholder approval should be sought .\nSimilarly , if this was a jurisdiction such as Hong Kong , the UK or South Africa , ANZ \u2019 s shareholders would be asked if they wished to splash $ 4.9 billion on Suncorp \u2019 s banking division .\nThe transaction industry would hate such a reform but if Chalmers wants to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of a transaction to vote would be a great start .\nAs for who is getting the better of the deal , like most competition-reducing acquisitions , both sets of shareholders will probably share in the upside while customers lose out .\nThis is the story of Australian banking since the combined market capitalisation of the big four bottomed at about $ 20 billion in 1992 when both ANZ and Westpac almost went broke thanks to Paul Keating \u2019 s 17 % official interest rates and the recession we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be approved because ANZ is a clear last in the home mortgage market with a loan book ( including investment properties ) worth just $ 261.1 billion , compared with market leader CBA on $ 516.6 billion , Westpac \u2019 s $ 430 billion and NAB \u2019 s $ 289.3 billion .\nSuncorp \u2019 s $ 46.2 billion residential book will still leave ANZ in third place with a combined $ 307.3 billion , hardly grounds for the ACCC to block the deal .\nSuncorp shares jumped 6.1 % or 68 cents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market believes ANZ has paid a full price but not gone completely over the top .\nThe only announced financial services merger that has been blocked by regulators was ANZ \u2019 s proposed purchase of National Mutual in 1990 , which then treasurer and acting prime minister Keating rejected in the following terms before introducing the quirky \u201c four pillars policy \u201d , which has never actually been legislated .\nThe Howard-Costello government was far too permissive on the financial services industry , particularly by waving through CBA \u2019 s $ 8 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the old State Bank of Victoria and State Bank of NSW under the one roof .\nSimilarly , then treasurer Wayne Swan should arguably have blocked Westpac \u2019 s $ 18.6 billion St George takeover in 2008 , as this also brought the old State Bank of South Australia and Advance Bank into the Westpac fold .\nNeither NAB or ANZ have snapped up any of Australia \u2019 s regional or former state banks over the past 20 years so it would be a bit rough to suddenly draw a red line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 4.9 billion on Suncorp \u2019 s banking division when all previous bank mergers have been waved through .",

history .\nFrom 1949 until 1972 , Labor was kept out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schism created by a right-wing religious section of the party .\nThe creation of the ( very Catholic ) Democratic Labor Party ( DLP ) helped keep the ALP in opposition for longer than would be typical in a normal political cycle .\nIt arguably divided the party along religious grounds .\nThe Liberal Party now faces the same situation and needs to react to ensure it doesn \u2019 t end up in opposition for a long period .\nIt has divided into two groups : the true Menzies Libs and the right-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is what I hear from many people not aligned with any political party .\nThis \u201c far right \u201d will do all it can to take over institutions such as the Liberals for the benefit of a few over the interests of the many .\nI note there are those in the party who believe they lost the election because they were not far right enough \u2014 which is as bizarre as suggesting that God will save the planet from climate change .\nBob Menzies , the founder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Forgotten People \u201d speech in 1942 , condemned fascism , socialism , communism and also laissez-faire economics : Those Liberals who claim the party should go back to \u201c its conservative roots \u201d need to read that speech because such roots do not grow in the soil of the far right .\nFar from it .\nThe far left is a different story .\nThere we have historically seen the extremes of Stalin and Mao Zedong , who between them caused the deaths of tens of millions of their own people .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than far-left dictators in a budyonovka instead of a black fez .\nIs there a similar far left in Australia ?\nThere are some crazies out there but the call for violent revolution seems to be almost \u2014 currently \u2014 non-existent .\nSome would argue it could be Extinction Rebellion that confronts the issue of climate action through disruption and civil disobedience , but it is neither violent nor does it want to control society .\nIt is focused on climate action .\nThere are some in it who criticised individual politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK .\nYet for the others , it is the only way they can respond to the blackmail activity undertaken by the Coalition climate deniers in Parliament .\nExtinction Rebellion is not a manifest danger to society ; the greater danger is from those who deny science .\nFor the left , just as the Liberals struggled with climate deniers , Labor needs to be careful that its climate change policies are not led by extremists who believe that severe economic and social costs of unbridled climate change action are just \u201c collateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are the Australian Council of Trade Unions ( ACTU ) and unions the extreme left ?\nThere are things they have said and done over time that I have strongly disagreed with or challenged .\nYet I \u2019 ve always said there is no real democracy without unions .\nIndeed , state-run unions in non-democratic countries such as China are next to useless and do nothing to protect the bona fide rights of workers .\nThe ACTU was also a major part of the great reforms in the Hawke-Keating period , changes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best in the world .\nThere are other unions who should hang their heads in shame .\nThe retail union , the Shop , Distributive and Allied Employees Association ( SDA ) , for example , worked with big business to cut Sunday penalty rates and then cried foul when the Fair Work Commission did the same for small business .\nThat is straight out dishonesty , hypocrisy and self-interest \u2014 based on maintaining membership .\nIt is similar to the duplicity practised by the big business it supports .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen some unions over the years that were just a front for criminals and fascists .\nThe Painters and Dockers union of the 1970s and \u2019 80s and the Builders Labourers Federation were noted for their violence , for murders and for a lack of respect for the law .\nUnions need to be regulated like the rest of us .\nThe violent part of the far left is in hibernation but can be woken easily and quickly .\nHaving said that , the

exonerated him was specifically rejected by the ombudsman .\nStaffing jobs were used for internal political work and nepotism \u2014 instead of serving the public , appointees worked , sometimes full-time , on factional hackery , or never showed up for work at all .\nAttempts were made to misdirect grants to factional mates .\nThe report finds there was a culture of branch stacking within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s faction , and the misconduct was openly or tacitly condoned by senior figures in the party .\nThe ombudsman and IBAC , the latter carefully and conveniently prevented by legislation from suggesting its subjects may have broken the law , went out of their way to explain that no laws were broken only because laws against abuse of public resources and misuse of office are so vague in Victoria as to be practically unenforceable .\nAs for the premier himself , the report states : Andrews agreed that he had been aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous few decades and that there had been people who had paid for the memberships of others over a long period .\nHe also agreed that the practice was not limited to one faction and occurred \u2018 across the board \u2019 \u2026 Andrews denied any personal knowledge of or involvement in such practices \u2026 Andrews agreed that branch stacking was a serious problem and that it could amount to a corruption risk in the sense that it could lead to the misuse of taxpayer or public funds in the pursuit of factional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch stacking was necessary to eliminate the risk of corruption .\nAndrews \u2019 evidence surely doesn \u2019 t add up .\nHe says he somehow knew but didn \u2019 t know .\nHe \u2019 d heard about such practices , but not any details of who might be doing it .\nHe \u201c made the distinction between having suspicions about people who might be engaging in the practice and having actual knowledge of specific people who engaged in such practices \u201d .\nSeriously \u2014 the man has been leader for 12 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening that is \u201c a serious problem \u201d and \u201c a corruption risk \u201d \u2014 and seems to do nothing about it .\nIndeed , he appoints as minister the man identified by IBAC as the leader of branch stacking and misuse of public resources , and then reappoints him in 2018 after he was dumped for alleged bullying .\nAnd , conveniently , after another colossal scandal involving the misuse of taxpayer-funded staff \u2014 the notorious red shirts scandal \u2014 Andrews \u2019 legislative fix for that outrage , and his subsequent changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to address the problem .\nIndeed , according to IBAC , \u201c the [ post-red shirt ] VIRTIPS Act also worsened the position on the use of electorate officers and ministerial staff for internal party-political activities \u201d , reflecting that the Andrews government \u201c was not concerned about preventing electorate officers and ministerial staff being used on internal party tasks \u201d

.\nHaving failed in his multiple attempts to overturn the results of a free and fair election so he could retain power , Donald Trump unleashed a mob that actually did achieve his aim of disrupting the certification of Joe Biden \u2019 s win .\nThis is why he \u2019 d incited them and why he did nothing to stop them .\nAs committee chairman Benny Thompson put it , \u201c For the weeks between the November election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force to be reckoned with \u2026 He recklessly blazed a path of lawlessness and corruption the cost of which democracy be damned .\nAnd then he stopped .\nFor 187 minutes , this man of unbridled destructive energy could not be moved \u2026 even though he was the only person in the world who could call off the mob.\n\u201d While Mike Pence , Trump \u2019 s beleaguered vice-president , requested to speak to or summon the Department of Defence , the DC Police Force , the Capitol Police Force , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead was fully occupied \u2014 watching Fox News on the TV in his dining room , tweeting to senators about delaying the election certification , chatting with Rudy Giuliani , and , of course , tweeting in ways that further inflamed his already overwrought followers .\nThe advice of the White House counsel , and those of \u201c team normal \u201d , was that Trump must tweet to his followers in no uncertain terms that he condemned their violence and wanted them to immediately go home .\nYet Trump refused .\nInstead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his disappointment with his besieged vice-president : \u201c Mike Pence didn \u2019 t have the courage to do what should have been done.\n\u201d The impact of this tweet on the crowd was instant .\nOf all the committee \u2019 s footage , these images hit hardest : marauding rioters halting to scrutinise Trump \u2019 s latest text or video on their phone , or attending to its reading or interpretation through the bullhorn wielded by the mob \u2019 s inciters , reacting as ordered .\nEither , as per the Pence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers and into the Capitol , or , when they were finally handed their marching orders by the ex-president at 4:17pm , by departing immediately .\nIt is shocking to realise how well they understood what \u201c their \u201d president was really trying to say .\nFor example , when Trump \u2014 under duress \u2014 tweets at 3:13pm for the rioters to \u201c respect the law and our great men and women in blue \u201d , the rioters are shown interpreting this tweet as explicitly not warning them of causing harm to members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the White House , those of Trump \u2019 s entourage were pleading with him to unambiguously condemn his supporters \u2019 violence .\nThe resulting tweet , with its confusing injunction to \u201c remain peaceful \u201d at a time when Trump had known for hours that a full-scale riot was underway , was compromised wording brokered by Ivanka Trump .\nWhat else did we learn that was new ?\nThat at around 2:24pm , when the Capitol had been violently breached and the rotunda was full of smoke , Capitol Police and Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives that they were calling loved ones to say goodbye .\nFar from remorseful , the president felt so justified in unleashing the rioters that day that when Kevin McCarthy called , telling him how his own staff were running for their lives and begging the president to call the mob off , Trump said he couldn \u2019 t because they were Antifa .\nWhen McCarthy insisted the mob was his people , Trump replied , \u201c Well , Kevin , I guess they \u2019 re more upset about the election theft than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going-for-the-jugular move that had been told to Cassidy Hutchinson was not confirmed , a Secret Service agent did validate her story about Trump \u2019 s insistence on being taken to the Capitol from the White House Ellipse , and the \u201c heated \u201d discussion that ensued when he was driven to the White House instead .\nIndeed , so desperate was Trump to get that decision reversed that his motorcade was placed on standby near WestExec for 45 minutes before a final decision not to go was achieved .\nCertainly , the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ex-president must be held accountable for his multiple crimes on that day , and all steps must be taken to ensure he never holds office again .\nThe senior Republican men like McCarthy and Mitch McConnell , who so clearly recognised the threat he posed in the hours and days after the Capitol attack , need to show the same courage as Trump \u2019 s more junior staff and tell the committee what they know about who the president called , and what he said , during the calls missing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of vice-chair Liz Cheney , presumably spoken to the entire American populace but

Sunday and ensure that another Morrison can never again rise through the ranks to become parliamentary leader and prime minister .\nThe reason ?\nMorrison \u2019 s 50-minute sermon examined in detail reveals a man who lives in a starkly different reality from most Australians .\nPress gallery journalists too should take the time to closely examine the words of Australia \u2019 s 30th prime minister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest stories of the decade : the coming to power of a politician so thoroughly in the thrall of a niche religious belief .\nCrikey has been pointing it out for at least a year , but it took Morrison \u2019 s departure to reveal the extent to which God had inhabited the Lodge over the past four years .\nMorrison \u2019 s lengthy sermon to Pentecostal believers gives us a better understanding of the defining features of his prime ministership : his disdain for secular accountability ( whether an ICAC or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office ) and his ability to mislead , be caught and yet carry on without apparent shame .\nUltimately Morrison reveals himself as a man who can justify much in the cause of spreading the dominion of the Lord .\nHere is what we have learnt , courtesy of Morrison himself : More than once Morrison has proclaimed the role of God in the birth of the Morrisons \u2019 first-born daughter , Abigail , on July 7 2007 \u2014 the seventh day of the seventh month of the seventh year \u2014 after more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Victory Life Centre sermon , he added a new and highly significant detail .\nHe said Jenny \u2019 s waters broke about 8am on July 6 .\nJenny would have been happy to give birth \u201c any time after about 10 o \u2019 clock that morning , I can tell you \u201d .\n\u201c And as we got later that night , it started to twig to me what was going on , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And Abby was born soon after at 1am on the seventh of the seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what that said to me was that God is faithful.\n\u201d It \u2019 s worth pausing to consider how realistic it is that God would have intervened in Jenny \u2019 s labour , but it carries a powerful meaning .\n\u2026 a signal from God that the Morrisons are special In Christianity , seven is the number of perfection \u2014 referring to the seventh day after God \u2019 s work was done .\n( The sixth , by contrast , is the number of man , a fallen being . )\nPentecostal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost magical , meaning .\nThe implication is that the Morrisons have a special destiny because God has singled them out with a 07/07/07 birth date , a meaning well known to Morrison \u2019 s audience .\nHe also spoke of the day he walked through the green belt in Wellington , New Zealand , and shouted at God in disappointment over the problems he and Jenny were having with conceiving a child : \u201c I let Him have it .\nI \u2019 d say if people had heard this [ shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Morrison told of walking into an art gallery run by a Christian couple in Bourke during a drought when he was treasurer .\nHe saw a painting of an old gum tree on the side of a flowing river and it reminded him of a biblical verse : \u201c Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord , and whose trust is in the Lord , for thy will be like a tree planted by the water that extends its roots by a stream , and does not fear when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be green .\nAnd it will not be anxious in a year of drought , nor cease to yield fruit.\n\u201d The gum tree by the river is a companion experience to one which Morrison related last year at a Pentecostal Christian conference where he saw a painting of a soaring eagle during the 2019 election campaign that he interpreted as a message from God to keep on going .\nDone something wrong ?\nDon \u2019 t worry about it A central point of Morrison \u2019 s address was that God understands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxieties better than you do , and that to overcome these anxieties just \u201c declare the name of Jesus and declare His forgiveness , and declare His blood on the cross \u201d .\n\u201c Be anxious for nothing.\n\u201d He repeated the phrase again and again , emphasising the word \u201c nothing \u201d and pointing out there were \u201c no exceptions \u201d .\nWhat was there to be anxious about ?\nMorrison referred to \u201c anxiety about our past , the scars , the hurt , the failings , the damage , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut you down \u2026 cripple you \u201d .\n\u201c You can not be held anxious over these things because God has broken [ the link ] .\n\u201d Linked to the idea that \u201c God loves you \u201d for who you are , it \u2019 s little wonder Morrison feels released from any guilt or anxiety over his actions .\nAnd surely God \u2019 s acceptance must matter more than any audit office investigation or a parliamentary committee finding .\nThe thought becomes scary when you recall that as prime minister Morrison had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThey come from Satan Morrison explicitly brought Satan into the mix as the being that makes accusations : \u201c Satan is known as the accuser , the great accuser , and he \u2019 ll keep throwing this stuff at you.\n\u201d According to Crikey \u2019 s theological expert , \u201c stuff \u201d can be anything the enemy wants to attack you with , justified or not .\nAnd Satan is attacking you because you are a Christian and you are a

better \u2014 a demoralising message , if nothing else , for Canberra \u2019 s machinery of government .\nMorrison clearly differentiates between Christians and the rest of society , those who don \u2019 t know \u201c the truth of God \u201d .\nSpeaking of treatments for anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully at the many provided , he saw \u201c a lot of parallels [ between ] what I was learning , and [ what I ] had always known about God , and how God seeks to engage with us \u201d .\n\u201c It \u2019 s funny how that happens , isn \u2019 t it , that people in a secular sphere discover what we already know in a spiritual sphere .\nIt \u2019 s the truth of God .\nIt \u2019 s the truth of God .\n\u201c No matter what society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how they might seek to deny it , or even dismiss it , the truth of God stands up and shines through.\n\u201d It is worth recalling that three years ago , and not all that far from Court \u2019 s church , Morrison promised $ 4 million in funding to the Esther Foundation rehab facility run by a Pentecostal pastor using religion-based therapies .\nSpeaking to the women of Esther , Morrison used the same Pentecostal language as he deployed at the Victory Life Centre .\nThe foundation has now collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young women stretching back more than a decade .\nHealth Minister Mark Butler is still unravelling how the funding came to be approved from the Health Department budget .\nFrom Morrison there is no word \u2014 but then none is required when you are the Lord \u2019 s anointed .", "author": "David Hardaker",

for close adviser raises yet more questions \u2014 and demands a wider inquiry", "content": "John Barilaro \u2019 s former media adviser \u2014 and now partner \u2014 was employed in a senior role at Investment NSW at the time the agency was processing the appointment of the apparently successful candidate Jenny West to the plum job of NSW trade commissioner based in New York .\nThe media adviser , Jennifer Lugsdin , took up the role of senior media adviser in August last year .\nIt was later revealed that Lugsdin and Barilaro were in a relationship after leaving their spouses .\nLugsdin arrived at Investment NSW the same month that West , a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the job following an independent selection process .\nThe offer was later rescinded as part of a chain of events that saw Barilaro himself gain the New York posting .\nThe fact that Lugsdin was employed by Investment NSW has been known in media and political circles but has so far been unexplored in the NSW upper house inquiry into how Barilaro ended up being appointed to the role .\nThe opposition-run inquiry received bombshell evidence last week from former Barilaro staffers that the then deputy premier had sought urgent advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministerial appointment \u2014 and that he had earlier wanted the trade posting \u201c for when I get the fuck out of this place [ NSW Parliament ] \u201d .\nThis has been denied by Barilaro .\nThe appointment of Lugsdin raises obvious questions for any investigation into the Barilaro saga .\nAs senior media adviser , how closely did she work with agency head Amy Brown ?\nWhat did she know about the state of play with the New York job ?\nIt also raises larger questions about a political culture where public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political purposes .\nIn an emailed response to Crikey \u2019 s questions , Investment NSW defended the integrity of Lugsdin \u2019 s appointment .\n\u201c Investment NSW engaged the services of an external recruitment agency in late July 2021 to provide a contingent labour resource to support the media team in a newly created agency , \u201d it said .\n\u201c The short-term engagement with the agency supplier , who was the employer of Ms Lugsdin , ended in December 2021 .\n\u201c The agreement with Ms Lugsdin \u2019 s employer was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workforce scheme , with Ms Lugsdin assessed as the most qualified and skilled candidate following the review of a number of applicants put forward by four pre-qualified suppliers.\n\u201d Crikey attempted to contact Jennifer Lugsdin at her new role as senior communications and media officer at the NSW Department of Communities and Justice but we received no response .\nIn terms of public perception , though , the appointment of Lugsdin risks being seen as symptomatic of a revolving-door culture where the government uses the public service for its own purpose .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barilaro using the public purse to fashion a benefit for himself via the New York trade job , if we are to believe evidence that last week emerged from former Barilaro staffers ( disputed by Barilaro ) .\nBarilaro had also employed 25-year-old Bridgette Joyce , daughter of then National Party leader Barnaby Joyce , as a senior adviser .\nThe taxpayer foots the bill for these jobs , but because they are classed as political they are not subject to public service employment standards .\nThe events that preceded Barilaro resigning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the turmoil that had engulfed the then deputy premier and those around him .\nIn late 2020 Barilaro took a month \u2019 s mental health leave after he threatened to withdraw the National Party from the NSW Coalition over government policy on koalas .\nIn May 2021 he took legal action against YouTube comedian Jordan Shanks over corruption allegations made by Shanks .\n( Barilaro was ultimately awarded $ 715,000 in damages in an action against Google . )\nBy August several of his staff had moved on , including Lugsdin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also announced he had split from his wife Deanna after 26 years .\nThe couple have three daughters .\nIn the wake of his resignation , ( unfounded ) rumours surfaced that Barilaro had been having an affair with Bridgette Joyce .\nIt later emerged that Barilaro was involved in a relationship with Lugsdin , who had also left her marriage .\nThe NSW upper house inquiry , run by the public accountability committee , has produced a drip of damaging revelations on the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring that led to Barilaro \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hampered by the government \u2019 s refusal , so far , to produce key documents requested by the committee .\nThe opposition has flagged that it may recall the upper house for an urgent sitting this week if the

Head .\nHowever , neither review appears to have the scope to investigate the revolving-door culture at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception \u2014 of the Barilaro saga .\nThat may only be possible in a

development between the airport and the Woolies .\nRent is paying someone else \u2019 s mortgage .\nSo ScoMo must be loving living free in the heads of progressives this past week or so .\nHe \u2019 s gone , his government is gone\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Perth church , in which he advocated trusting in God , not government , set things , well , aflame , and this was followed by the revelations about his government \u2019 s \u201c Saturday surprise \u201d , the shock discovery of an \u201c illegal vessel \u201d heading towards us blah blah blah .\nWe all knew this was true desperation , based on the faint hope the vote might be close .\nIt wasn \u2019 t , and the recent report has made clear just how ruthlessly , wantonly mendacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a fresh burst at ScoMo for announcing he won \u2019 t turn up to this week \u2019 s parliamentary session .\nWe sure do love to hate this bloke .\nWith Labor now clarifying , reneging , or simply not doing what it said it wouldn \u2019 t do but some thought it might , progressives are entering a period of sustained dissatisfaction , able to direct neither hate nor love at Labor , trapped in the purgatory of ambivalence .\nGrabbing a last chance to hate on ScoMo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me that most of the charges against him in recent days are either mere repetition of earlier malfeasance , or an active misconstruction of what he has said and done .\nSo he \u2019 s going to skip the opening of a Parliament run by a government and crossbench who crushed him .\nSo what ?\nSo he \u2019 s giving a quick bucks speech in Tokyo , and probably dissembling about it .\nReally , so what ?\nThe election day pseudo-emergency \u201c on the water \u201d ?\nThe report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we all pretty much knew .\nIt deserved to be covered , but it \u2019 s no real revelation .\nFinally , and with most substance , there was that speech at Margaret Court \u2019 s Victory Life Church , in which he was said to have said that \u201c we don \u2019 t trust government or the United Nations \u201d .\nAs Christians , they put their trust in God and the eternal .\nThis was treated not only as a revelation , but as a logical conundrum , a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and not trust it ?\nHe was playing us all along .\nBut let \u2019 s look at the fuller context of what he said : \u201c God \u2019 s kingdom will come .\nIt \u2019 s in his hands .\nWe trust in him .\nWe don \u2019 t trust in governments .\nWe don \u2019 t trust in the United Nations , thank goodness .\nWe don \u2019 t trust in all these things , fine as they may be and as important as the role that they play .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it and they are important .\nBut as someone who \u2019 s been in it , if you are putting your faith in those things as I put my faith in the lord , you \u2019 re making a mistake .\nThey are earthly , they are fallible .\nI \u2019 m so glad we have a bigger hope.\n\u201d Well , there \u2019 s a lot of ways to interpret \u2018 God \u2019 s kingdom \u2019 and I bet ScoMo \u2019 s is pretty literal .\nBut the rest of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious side , the sort of politics that would characterise the beliefs of just about every UK and Commonwealth prime minister from the 19th century to now , with only a few recent exceptions from the progressive side .\nMorrison \u2019 s position is one that would be recognised by Burke , Bagehot , John Macmurray , Hayek , Paul Tillich and any number of founding figures of modern belief you might want to cite .\nThe incomprehension that greeted this position was a new low in the very low standard of Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion between Patricia Karvelas , Samantha Maiden and David Speers on RN Breakfast last Friday , in which all three \u2014 in flagship positions in Australian political commentary \u2014 seemed incapable of understanding this proposition that you could govern while holding government to be fallible .\nListening to it was like watching three apes handle a S\u00e8vres vase .\nMaiden suggested , gigglingly , that it was \u201c bat\u2026 rhymes with \u2018 it \u2019 \u201c .\nSo we were back to Lucille Ball-ism \u2014 anything outside the impossibly narrow intellectual world of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pathetic and embarrassing , at a national level .\nM \u2019 colleague Keane \u2019 s account was far more cogent , but I disagree with his slotting of ScoMo \u2019 s beliefs into neoliberalism .\nIn this instance , it \u2019 s consistent liberal-conservatism .\nLook , there \u2019 s no doubt that throughout office Morrison has held his religion close , and has steered his actions by it \u2014 in a disguised fashion .\nIndeed , your correspondent was the first to remark on this .\nIn 2018 , I had initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using God as a comforter while doing whatever bastardry he needed .\nBut then : \u201c But as the evidence rolls in , I \u2019 m wondering if I was mistaken .\nIs ScoMo the other type of evangelical , the true believer , who got the faith young and hard , and who sees it as the central organising principle of his life ?\nIn that case , for ScoMo , the tragicomedy of politics is just the business of the fallen world , through which one moves , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion that he would pray for rain to end the drought , and a glimpse of him praying , has strengthened the sense that this is a big deal for him .\n\u201c But what really caught my eye was his remarks on the night of the prime minister \u2019 s awards for science ceremony last week .\nIt \u2019 s an acid trip of a speech , but here \u2019 s the kicker : \u201c I have no doubt that as you do that , you think it might be there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it into a theory , then you follow the rulebook , but it all begins with something you believe \u2026 \u201d The full speech clearly revealed that he was using this official engagement to subtly proselytise .\nMorrison didn \u2019 t \u201c reveal \u201d himself at the Victory Life Church four years later , he simply kept on being who he was .\nIn the early months of his premiership , his religiosity was overt , and disconcerting .\nI suspect his advisers then consciously toned it down into a generic religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and they came up with the theme of \u201c the promise of Australia \u201d , which secularised the religious impulse , stole back the \u201c light on the hill \u201d from Labor , and helped ensure victory against the latter \u2019 s cluelessly empty effort .\nSo we were led by a religious subversive \u2014 and , as David Hardaker \u2019 s reporting revealed , something of a gnostic .\nMorrison and his family were bound up to some degree with QAnon followers , pursuers of the secret knowledge .\nBut I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the Morrison governments as theocracies .\nThis isn \u2019 t very accurate .\nIt is absolutely possible that Morrison \u2019 s literalism includes a fatalism \u2014 and that that played a role in his actions , or lack thereof , during the floods and fires .\nAbsolutely , and pretty full-on to think of as dictating some day-to-day government conduct .\nBut as far as structural change to Australia , there \u2019 s really been not much at all .\nWe live in a secular society with a welfare state , socialised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations culture in our sense of self , readily available abortion , and same-sex marriage voted up by acclaim .\nWhen we get a Christian theocracy , you \u2019 ll know it .\nIn Texas at the moment , a 1925 law is being reintroduced which would make it a felony to drive someone to an out-of-state clinic to get an abortion \u2014 for a pregnancy they got in part because sex education and any books about it are banned at their school .\nThe Supreme Court may well validate this .\nGilead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here .\nDuring his premiership , Morrison did show a basic distrust of state extension , which may have had a religious basis .\nHis slowness to act on JobKeeper etc during the pandemic may have been founded in both a politically liberal and religiously conservative apprehension that once you expand the state \u2019 s responsibility to mitigate collective misfortune , you won \u2019 t be able to wind it back \u2014 as the Albanese government discovered with COVID isolation payments .\nBut really , he presided for a term-and-a-bit over the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what Bernie Sanders wants for the US , so let \u2019 s keep a sense of perspective about where we are .\nMorrison has been chased from power over everything except the imagination of progressives , whose dreams he stalks .\nWhy do so many find it difficult to let go ?\nBecause with Labor and the Greens \u2019 electoral success , progressivism has been deprived of its fantasies of a new order .\nEveryone knew it was a fantasy , but that doesn \u2019 t really matter where fantasies are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backtracking from several of its modest promises , and reaffirming the things many progressives dreamed it might only be bluffing about \u2014 leaves you with nothing to believe .\nAnd secular progressivism , without a revolutionary fire in its belly , has an emptiness at its core .\nIt must define itself against a fearsome , unified right .\nAnd that right has just been shown to be a hopeless rabble .\nThe paradoxes in all this are pretty clearly indicated by the reaction to Bill Shorten \u2019 s withdrawal of Medicare forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent \u201d instead of \u201c mother \u201d .\nThe obvious point about this is that if the Morrison government had been on any sort of real culture war footing , these forms would never have been issued \u2014 or issued , and then used to create a preelection culture war .\nThe second point is that by asserting the traditional and grounded term of \u201c mother \u201d , Shorten affirmed to progressives that Labor had made a decisive break with the \u201c full progressive \u201d package ( and rightly so , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but Labor had made it clear that it was tracking in this direction in the second election debate , when Anthony Albanese answered the question \u201c What is a woman ?\n\u201d by answering \u201c a human female \u201d .\nIt had taken Labor six years of talking about getting \u201c back to the suburbs \u201d for it to actually reorient its cultural values and do it .\nDoing so was a vital part of winning its narrow majority ; deprived of that culture war ( which is really a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most fundamental , transcultural features of human existence ) , the Coalition could only make the Katherine Deves stuff a lame-duck thing about free thought , which no one cared about .\nSo much of the hatred of Morrison is displaced anger that progressives do not have the Labor government they want : the last Whitlam government , in effect .\nWith those signal moves on the sex/gender issue , Labor is finally a post-Whitlam entity .\nIt took a long time and a lot of wasted years for Labor to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to examine their own politics with a cold eye in this respect , they might well have been able to return to power in 2016 and win the post-Howard era .\nProgressives \u2019 blindness to the fact that most people are rather closer to Morrison \u2019 s worldview ( with much less Christian literalness ) than theirs led them into two defeats .\nLabor \u2019 s narcissistic obsession with simultaneously minimising the Greens and winning the \u2018 burbs cost it two elections .\nSo forget ScoMo .\nHe wasn \u2019 t a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t a terrible one either .\nHe strikes one as a standard literal Christian with some minor hypocrisies , and a few neuroses which have clearly stunned him into inaction and magical thinking in key moments through his adult life , from his career disasters in the tourism industry to his inadequate response to the challenges of COVID-era government .\nPraise be to God for his bountiful gifts as far as that goes , because with a clear-eyed right-wing atheist in that spot , the Coalition could have turned the result into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have emerged narrowly victorious .\nMorrison continued the reign of a right-wing formation with no real idea of how to reconstruct the country for the challenges ahead , and he did so with the help of a monolithic right-wing mainstream media , a mainstream press corps not worth a bucket of spit , and a decade of global easy money .\nNothing ScoMo does post-politically in terms of cashing in is likely to be worse than numerous Labor figures taking their expertise \u2014 earned from decades of support by the labour movement \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaming , defence and resources industries to teach them how to get around the feeble taxes and regulations that Labor tries to put in their way .\nThe last decade of right-wing misrule needs to be prosecuted , as I have said , for the next three years , in inquiry after inquiry .\nBut the purpose of that is to show that right-wing politics as a whole is institutionally and ideologically corrupt , not that one bad preacher man led us all astray .\nMeanwhile , we now have a Labor government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to an unchanging defence establishment taking us towards war over Taiwan , to no change to the starvation penury that benefits are set at , to no change to the black gulag this country is running , especially across the north and west of this continent , to moving against land clearing slow enough for farmers to get it all done before legislation comes in , to no real change to the neoliberal Fair Work Commission established by the Gillard government to exclude workers from the industrial relations process , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for progressives to work on , but only as tough , unsatisfying politics of ideas and policy waged against our own side .\nFor us \u201c left materialists \u201d that will include supporting Labor on its move to the cultural centre against progressivist open-ended demands .\nWith all those lovely fights to have , forget Morrison .\nTime to give him notice from the inside of your head for banging too many nails into the wall .\nNot for his sake , but for the sake of our own project and the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years .", "author": "Guy Rundle", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/07/27/scomo-time-progressives-evicted-him/",

Party rort yet \u2014 the Australian National Audit Office ( ANAO ) has found that 65 % of a $ 1.1 billion set of grants made under five rounds of the Building Better Regions Fund ( BBRF ) weren \u2019 t the ones that should have been awarded under a fair and open process .\nAnd , of course , they went to National Party and Liberal electorates \u2014 all in a program that , like the sports rorts grants , was meticulously designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from scrutiny .\nThe auditor-general \u2019 s report details the lengths to which the Coalition government went to create a program that pretended to be about objective assessment of applications , but was mostly decided by a National Party-controlled committee , which rejected departmental advice and instead based decisions on electoral considerations , particularly ahead of the past two elections .\nAnd while the sport rorts scandal was about a program shifted to the Australian Sports Commission in order to take it beyond the reach of the existing rules around grant allocation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in its sixth round , was run by the Department of Infrastructure \u2014 ground zero for some of the most famous rorts and scandals of the past two decades , including the original regional rorts , the wild overpayment to a Liberal donor for land near the new Sydney airport , and the notorious car park rorts administered by Alan Tudge .\nInfrastructure is subject to the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines ( CGRGs ) , so here \u2019 s how the Coalition planned to get around them : \u2022 Don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the annual round of grant applications were made by a panel of Coalition politicians chaired by a senior Nationals MP , which would consult with cabinet .\nThis meant then deputy prime minister Michael McCormack for the crucial round at the end of 2018 that decided projects ahead of the 2019 election , and Barnaby Joyce for the late-2020 round that would make decisions in the run-up to the 2022 election \u2014 which Scott Morrison was considering holding in later 2021 .\n\u2022 Rig the criteria .\nWhile the department called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of published criteria , the final criterion was \u201c other factors \u201d , which had some examples but was undefined and left to the ministerial panel .\nSome of the examples of \u201c other factors \u201d included \u201c the Australian government \u2019 s priorities \u201d and \u201c community support for projects , which can include support from local MPs \u201d .\nThe ANAO concluded \u201c this factor was a key consideration across all previous funding rounds .\nWhile its wording suggests that the confirmation of community support would be evidenced through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis is that such support , particularly from parliamentarians , has been largely coordinated outside the application process by the chairs through their offices , and some members of the panel \u201d .\n\u2022 Ignore any attempts to impose good process .\nThe Department of Finance actually queried why Infrastructure had added this \u201c other \u201d criterion , and was fobbed off .\nThe result : according to the ANAO , \u201c the ministerial panel has increasingly relied upon the \u2018 other factors ' \u201d as each round went by .\nThe result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren \u2019 t approved by the department but got funded anyway .\n\u2022 Hide the evidence .\nUnder the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines , the minister for finance must be advised if a minister decides to approve an application that has been rejected by their department \u2014 thus creating a paper trail .\nHow did they get around that ?\nThe ANAO pointed out that for rounds three and five \u2014 which were the preelection rounds \u2014 \u201c rather than clearly identifying which applications should be successful up to the limit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel select from a \u2018 pool \u2019 of projects \u2026 The significance of the changes made to the department \u2019 s approach was that , for the fifth round , there would be no circumstance in which any of the 528 applications seeking $ 761.4 million in grant funding that had been assessed as representing value with relevant money would need to be reported to the finance minister \u201d .\n\u2022 Don \u2019 t keep proper records : \u201c Appropriate records were not made of the decision-making process .\nWhile not good practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices for the decision-making process deteriorated significantly in later rounds.\n\u201d \u2022 Pork-barrel like hell .\nThe ANAO : \u201c the Liberal Party and ALP held the greatest number of electorates associated with eligible applications ( on average , each had 24 electorates , or 35 % of applicable electorates ) .\nFunding outcomes were more favourable for applications from Liberal-held electorates , which received twice as many grants per electorate , with average funding per electorate being between $ 1.6 million ( round one ) and $ 3.1 million ( round four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALP electorates ; while the Nationals accounted for fewer electorates ( 16 in each round or 24 % of applicable electorates ) , applications funded from these electorates outperformed those in Liberal Party and ALP electorates in terms of both average number of grants and value of grants.\n\u201d The lesson ?\nYou can tighten the rules around grant allocation all you like , but a determined rorter will always find a way to get around them .\nThe only fix is to get politicians out of grant allocation entirely .\nThey just @

become relevant again", "content": "After being marginalised in the last Parliament , Pauline Hanson is cashing in \u2014 both metaphorically and literally \u2014 on the debate about establishing an Indigenous Voice to Parliament .\nHanson came into the 47th Parliament as a diminished figure .\nAfter early returns suggested her Senate spot was in doubt , Hanson was able to scrape in over Queensland LNP \u2019 s Amanda Stoker and minor parties United Australia Party and Legalise Cannabis Australia .\nDespite boasting an increase in support \u2014 which can be attributed to the party \u2019 s choice to run candidates in more House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearly 3 % swing away from it in Queensland Senate voting .\nOne factor contributing to One Nation \u2019 s shrinking vote was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australian politics .\nThe party \u2019 s bread-and-butter policy , reducing immigration , was sidelined as Australia closed its borders for much of the previous Parliament .\nBy the time the election came around , unemployment was at a 50-year-low .\nThe pandemic response was a major issue and One Nation \u2019 s anti-vaccine mandate , anti-lockdown stances were both unpopular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup of the 47th Parliament has imperilled Hanson \u2019 s relevance even further .\nThe Senate \u2019 s progressive majority combined with the balance of power being held by Greens and the crossbench means that the Labor government has multiple options for passing legislation without having to deal with One Nation .\nThe Voice to Parliament debate has thrown Hanson a political lifeline , but it \u2019 s not one she recognised at first .\nSoon after being reelected , Hanson laid out her plans for the next Parliament in an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted the interview to her Facebook with a caption that highlighted the COVID-19 response , multinationals taxation , family law , immigration and energy as her top political issues .\nVoice to Parliament and Indigenous issues were notably absent .\nThe first time that Hanson mentioned the Voice to Parliament on social media this term was her July 14 interview with Sky News host Chris Smith .\nThe next day , Hanson put out a media release claiming that the policy would create an \u201c Australian apartheid \u201d and that First Nations peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticising the lack of detail from the government .\nHanson \u2019 s audience immediately responded .\nThe July 15 media release got 5300 reactions , more than 1100 comments and 700 shares on Facebook \u2014 large numbers , even for Hanson \u2019 s sizeable audience .\nIt was clear that this issue was one that played perfectly to One Nation \u2019 s base .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise that Hanson , ever the media manipulator , used the first opportunity in Parliament to carry out a race-related protest .\nHer Acknowledgement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional and new media attention .\nHanson \u2019 s viral post-walkout video statement has been viewed more than 280,000 times on Facebook .\nIn it , she echoes many of the arguments against the Voice to explain why she suddenly opposed the Acknowledgement of Country after having sat through hundreds of them .\nSince her first post about the Voice in the middle of July , 15 of the 33 Facebook posts by Hanson have been about either the Voice or the Acknowledgement of Country .\nIn the past week , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media analysis tool CrowdTangle , her top two posts during that time have been about the Voice .\nHanson and her team saw her audience \u2019 s appetite for the topic and leaned into it .\nHanson \u2019 s criticism of the Voice to Parliament is a return to home turf .\nHanson infamously started off her political career by being disendorsed by the Liberal Party for a letter to a newsletter about Indigenous welfare .\nSince then , she has scapegoated different groups \u2014 First Nations peoples , Asians , Muslims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigotry as her core political messages .\nThis passage from her 1996 maiden speech to Parliament could be repurposed verbatim to her campaign against the Voice : Last Friday , Hanson officially staked out her position : \u201c Pauline Hanson \u2019 s One Nation will spearhead the campaign for the \u2018 no \u2019 vote in the coming referendum on an indigenous \u2018 voice to Parliament \u2019 [ sic ] , \u201d read a media release .\nAccompanying the release was a link to One Nation \u2019 s store , which is already selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash in on the interest .\nShe boasted to The Daily Telegraph that she had registered 46 web domains for the campaign ( Crikey was only able to find two Voice-related domains registered to One Nation ) .\nMaking Hanson the face of the \u201c no \u201d vote will likely be a mistake for the campaign .\nDespite her notoriety , Hanson remains an unpopular and incompetent politician who has failed to grow her party from the fringes , even as other populist parties like United Australia Party have found a footing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition of people from the left and right of politics without Hanson \u2019 s political baggage would likely have a much better chance at defeating the push .\nBut for Hanson , it \u2019 s a gift .\nThe Voice to Parliament referendum will be a national debate about race centring on a complex model that \u2019 s vulnerable to scare campaigns .\nHanson has already shown she has no interest in good faith debate , falsely labelling a Voice body a \u201c third tier of government \u201d ( God forbid she finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will elevate her as one of the few mainstream politicians willing to oppose the popular proposal that came out of the Uluru Statement from the Heart process .\nAfter a close brush with political death , Pauline Hanson is set to become one of the main figures of the 47th Parliament thanks to the Voice to Parliament referendum .\nDoes Hanson add anything of value to the political debate in this country ?\nLet us know your thoughts by writing to letters @ crikey.com.au .\nPlease include your full name to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to edit for length and clarity .", "author":

Your answer could reveal how you vote", "content": "Many commentators have pontificated on the socio-economic divisions revealed in May \u2019 s federal election outcome .\nA particular narrative emerged \u2014 pushed by the AFR , Waleed Aly and even Victorian MP Tim Smith \u2014 that the Coalition is becoming the home of the working class , while Labor , Greens and teal voters are increasingly affluent .\nOn Tuesday , Crikey \u2019 s Guy Rundle posited that Labor is now \u201c the party of capital \u201d .\nSay what you like about Labor \u2019 s governing choices , but are capital-owners really Labor \u2019 s new base ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nMost of these takes have relied on vibes more than statistics .\nThankfully analyses of Australian Cooperative Election Survey ( ACES ) data presented at a Macquarie University seminar last week shed new light on the question .\nThe data suggests the real dividing line in Australian voting patterns is not income , but asset ownership .\nParticularly home ownership .\nAnalysis by YouGov data scientist Shaun Ratcliff shows a significant divergence in the election results between homeowners and renters .\nMore owners moved towards or stayed with the Coalition , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor , the Greens and teals .\nThe more assets someone owned ( predominantly housing ) , the more likely they were to either stay with or defect to the Coalition .\nSome voters with higher incomes did move to Labor , the Greens and teals ( though some also moved towards the Coalition , and Labor \u2019 s primary vote share is still lower among higher-income people ) , but they were much less likely to do so if they owned one or more houses .\nThe biggest determinant of who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income .\nThis divide wasn \u2019 t just evident post-election \u2014 cannier political operatives took note and adjusted their strategies during the campaign .\nPollster Kos Samaras , whose firm RedBridge advised many teal independent candidates , told Crikey he advised them that the voters most likely to move away from the conservatives were renters , then mortgagees , but not outright owners .\nThey also targeted electorates where recent demographic shifts had increased the numbers of younger renters .\nOn election night and in its aftermath , many commentators assumed that swings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wealthy people had changed their votes .\nBut this is what statisticians like Ratcliff call an \u201c ecological fallacy \u201d : they \u2019 d missed that it was often the least wealthy people in richer areas , particularly those renting in areas they couldn \u2019 t afford to buy a home , who drove the teal wave , \u201c Greenslide \u201d and change of government .\nThe housing divide might seem strange given Labor dropped its controversial negative gearing and capital gains tax policies .\nBut the relationship between homeownership and voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1990s \u201d , according to Ratcliff , encompassing multiple party platforms .\nMy guess is that those without assets are far more focused on their income from work , and thus are attracted to Labor , which emphasises jobs and wage growth .\nConversely , those who own assets \u2014 especially multiple \u2014 have a vested interest in booming asset markets and low capital taxation , on which the Coalition holds an entrenched electoral advantage .\nThe Greens also appeal to many renters .\nAcademic Ben Spies-Butcher , who also presented at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election the Greens gained the support of 18.9 % of private renters \u2014 35.6 % of those renting from or living with family \u2014 but only 13.6 % of mortgagees and 8.7 % of outright owners .\nHow will the politics of homeownership evolve amid interest rate hikes ?\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t had interest rate rises before at a time when housing was this unaffordable .\nIn 2022 , housing was a major election issue .\nIn 2025 , housing will be the defining issue , \u201d Samaras says .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow its support among mortgagees , who will now be much more conscious of their income and costs than their investment value , while maintaining the support of renters whose costs are also rising .\nLabor \u2019 s proposed review of the Reserve Bank could prove significant , and if it can follow through on its promise to get wages moving , it could be rewarded .\nConversely , the right could frame itself as the true defender of aspirational wealth-builders and grow its advantage in this cohort .\nSamaras believes the Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super for housing , including lowering the threshold for accessing your super to cope with mortgage stress \u201d .\nBut in the long term , doubling down on its home-owning base could spell trouble for the right .\n\u201c The potential issue for the Coalition is that the share of non-owners has increased slowly over the last couple of decades , and is much higher for younger generations than it was for older generations at the same age , \u201d says Ratcliff .\n\u201c This could point to a political issue for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed was likely one of the reasons they lost so many seats in the large

political norms and politicians engaging in deception \u2014 but only when they \u2019 re the victims .\nNormally the passage into opposition elicits a remarkable transformation in former government ministers .\nHaving been passionate in their loathing of transparency and accountability as ministers , and committed to providing as little information as possible , they become ardent advocates of parliamentary scrutiny and supporters of institutions designed to limit the exercise of executive power .\nAll , naturally , in aid of political attacks on the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MPs are now appalled that it was their own government keeping them in the dark and engaging in the trashing of norms , in the form of Scott Morrison \u2019 s Jim \u2019 s Mowing approach to ministerial roles .\nMost of the former ministers of the Morrison government must be wondering whether they too were on the list of ministers who secretly had the prime minister as their ministerial buddy \u2014 a list already long enough with Greg Hunt ( another glorious footnote to that splendid political career ) , Mathias Cormann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have sunk any further anyway ) , Keith Pitt and Angus Taylor , although in Taylor \u2019 s case you can \u2019 t blame Morrison for thinking he had to play the equivalent role to the carny guy who helps the little kids drive the dodgems .\nToday we learnt that Josh Frydenberg and Karen Andrews also had Morrison as their silent \u2014 very silent \u2014 partner , and perhaps Anne Ruston at Social Services too .\nMost aggrieved , naturally , are the Nationals , who learn that one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s dial-a-ministry : the aptly named Pitt who was too fossil fuel even for Morrison \u2019 s coal-flavoured taste , and seemingly committed to ensuring that a swathe of Liberal MPs on the NSW Central Coast and Sydney beach suburbs lost their seats as a result of the PEP11 gas drilling proposal \u2014 a rare offshore gas project unbeloved of the Coalition .\nAll of these complainants had no issue with Morrison trashing other political norms , or his routine lying to voters .\nOnly when it came their turn to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political character have they decided he went too far .\nNone of them cavilled when Morrison trashed other longstanding norms and conventions .\nNo one objected to the appointment of a veteran Liberal staffer to head Treasury and then Prime Minister and Cabinet , or to Morrison \u2019 s demotion of the public service to a policy implementation unit .\nThey had no problems with the stacking of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal .\nBillion-dollar grant programs used for election pork-barrelling were of no moment .\nSmearing the partner of an alleged sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying to Parliament irrelevant , misleading international leaders and leaking their messages for political gain a trifle .\nAnd no one ever batted an eyelid at the torrent of lies that poured from Morrison \u2019 s mouth .\nDid the penny drop then that this was a man with contempt for the basic conventions and informal rules that help regulate any democracy ?\nSeemingly not \u2014 that moment had to await Coalition MPs joining the rest of us as the suckers of ScoMo .\nIt \u2019 s a legitimate question , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a very long time .\nAbandoning John Howard \u2019 s support for a comprehensive emissions

off since Tony Abbott became leader and the goal of securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions , norms and the customs of Australian politics became paramount .\nThe side that once preached conservatism and hectored others about standards and civility , that patiently explained that well-tried and tested institutions and rules should not be changed lightly , would readily chuck all that in the bin for a chance at power .\nScott Morrison merely pulled that mask off completely and showed the face of power over any principle .", "author": "Bernard Keane", "url":

We asked a lawyer to unravel Morrison\u2019s biggest lies", "content": "I am reading words like sinister , delusional , unhinged , god-like \u2014 all written by the usually sober , cynical journalists of the mainstream press gallery about Scott Morrison .\nEverybody is flummoxed .\nAnthony Albanese \u2019 s astonishment at his press conference yesterday wasn \u2019 t feigned .\nConstitutional lawyers are back in hot demand , being asked questions they never expected to contemplate .\nBut where \u2019 s the idiot \u2019 s guide to this shemozzle ?\nHere , of course .\nHow can you have two ministers for one portfolio ?\nThere \u2019 s no law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any law at all in relation to the appointment and responsibility of ministers .\nSection 64 of the constitution says that the governor-general appoints ministers of state , and they serve at his or her pleasure .\nIt doesn \u2019 t say anything about portfolios or the practical workings of authority and decision-making .\nSo , in theory , you can have two ministers of health , merrily exercising all the extraordinary powers given to that role \u2014 for example , the Biosecurity Act power to lock you up in your own home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undergo medical procedures against your will .\nLook it up .\nMorrison could have done that to you .\nFrom what has emerged so far , it seems not .\nThe governor-general says he swore Morrison in to at least some of his extra ministries , which is all that \u2019 s required for the appointments to be valid .\nThere is no legal requirement to tell anyone what they did .\nWhy are they saying it was an \u2018 attack on our democracy \u2019 ?\nBecause it was .\nOur system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution and mostly operated by convention , the so-called Westminster system inherited from England .\nMost of the rules are unwritten , honoured by tradition and a shared interest in maintaining democracy .\nIn fairness , Morrison spent his entire time in office trashing conventions , one after the other , so we shouldn \u2019 t be surprised .\nNevertheless , this one was truly shocking .\nThe idea that , for example , the minister for Home Affairs , who has extraordinary personal powers , did not know because she was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same powers , is beyond comprehension .\nMorrison \u2019 s actions were the opposite of what a leader who honours democracy would do .\nThey were the actions of a proto-fascist .\nWhat saved us was that he was too lazy , stupid and incompetent a proto-fascist to do too much actual harm .\nBut he could have .\nDoesn \u2019 t the government have its own lawyers ?\nOh , yes .\nMany .\nAccording to initial reports , then attorney-general Christian Porter was in the thick of this , advising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as extra health and finance ministers was above board .\nThe reports say Porter advised he didn \u2019 t even need to be sworn in .\nThat was wrong , if it is what Porter advised , but who knows what really happened .\nConventionally , Porter would not have given any such advice without first seeking his own advice from the solicitor-general .\nWhether that happened we are entitled to find out but don \u2019 t yet have a clue .\nPorter , of course , was not much one for convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding our breath .\nBut did Morrison use his powers ?\nAgain , who the hell knows ?\nHe has acknowledged that he did use his power as resources minister to override the other minister for resources , Keith Pitt , and knock back an offshore mining project proposal .\nBut how could that even work ?\nIt couldn \u2019 t .\nThen treasurer Josh Frydenberg didn \u2019 t know that Morrison was also treasurer .\nThey could have made directly contradictory decisions on the same question at the same time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and might turn out to be , a question for the courts to unravel .\nThe mining company is suing , claiming that Morrison \u2019 s decision was invalid .\nIt does seem that the legal questions are going to be mostly hypothetical , because Morrison didn \u2019 t bother doing much more than collect the job titles .\nPresumably he didn \u2019 t also collect the pay , but would you put it past him ?\nThis is the surpassing mystery .\nIt aligns with what we understand of Morrison \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in any other frame .\nAs behaviour , it was psychopathic .\nAs governance , it was contemptuous .\nHas the governor-general been compromised ?\nSadly , yes .\nDavid Hurley has sought to distance himself , with the Morrison-like excuse that it wasn \u2019 t his job to question his prime minister \u2019 s preference or to insist that the appointments be publicly announced .\nTechnically , yes , but the reality is that he was co-opted into the conspiracy and he should have acted to preserve the integrity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he should have insisted otherwise , or resigned .\nConsequently , the governor-general \u2019 s ability to continue in his role has to be under serious question .\nWhat can we do to Morrison ?\nParliament can censure him , which has no consequence apart from awkwardness on the backbench if he bothers showing up to work ( given he has said that he doesn \u2019 t really do politics any more , that \u2019 s not a given ) .\nIt can \u2019 t kick him out .\nReally this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook , but they won \u2019 t get a say until the next election ( we have no mechanism for recalling a sitting member ) .\nIf Morrison heeds the calls to resign from Parliament \u2014 as he should but won \u2019 t until he \u2019 s secured a job ( seriously , though , who would hire him now ? )\n\u2014 then he can just take his money and run .\nAll we can do , those of us who were declaring way back in 2018 or earlier that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you so .\nAnd try to repair the damage .\nDo you believe the governor-general has been compromised ?\nLet us know your thoughts by writing to letters @ crikey.com.au .\nPlease

conference was just pure pleasure , wasn \u2019 t it ?\nNow that he no longer rules us , one could watch without that clench in the stomach that came on every time he did one of these during his premiership .\nNow you could just sit back and watch a master of casuistry , still at the top of his game .\nThere was a circus air about it , a strongman coming into the auditorium to have an audience throw darts into his thick hide .\nThe Great Confuso did not disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw it open to questions and , as a storm of noise erupted , said : \u201c Don \u2019 t shout ; we \u2019 ll go right round , we \u2019 ve got plenty of time.\n\u201d There was a strong sense that he was enjoying the workout ; that he \u2019 d missed this , been bored .\nThe same can not be said for the press , as they tried to pin down , to change and mix the metaphor , this greased , lipsticked pig .\nScoMo was at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to account for the fact that the only time he used these COVID emergency powers was for the PEP-11 water pollution issue , which had nothing to do with COVID .\nThat was a cat \u2019 s cradle of crazed logic .\nTo some extent , he did give a workable official rationale for this unprecedented set of decisions : that with COVID we were in uncharted territory , anything was possible , and he needed to be in a position to take charge of certain departments immediately , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments \u2014 you can \u2019 t , as prime minister , start directly ordering the Health Department around , even if the Health minister is foaming at the mouth on the floor .\nIn that sense , Morrison has precedent for the decision : during the first Whitlam government , Whitlam and deputy PM Lance Barnard were sworn in to 27 ministries , before the Labor caucus was in a position to elect a ministry .\nMorrison justified the secrecy of it by the fact that , unlike Whitlam and Barnard , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offices were dormant until COVID offed his colleagues .\nTo make it public would have created confusion and panic ; to tell his fellow ( co- ) ministers would have ensured that it leaked .\nHe was safe in confiding it to Simon Benson and Geoff Chambers as they wrote their blow-by-blow COVID book Plagued , because those two would have kept schtum if ScoMo had broken down and confessed to being a North Korean agent , planning the nuclear obliteration/improvement of Sydney .\nSo you can get to a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott Morrison is weirder than Tony Abbott \u2014 coming , implicitly , from Tony Abbott \u2014 is false .\nNo one is weirder than Sir Onion .\nBut in order for ScoMo \u2019 s claimed sense of potential crisis to be real , where would you have to start from ?\nThe answer would be the supposition that COVID would be really , really bad , far worse than the crises \u2014 such as World War II \u2014 thrown in Morrison \u2019 s face .\nYou might well swear in backstop ministers if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might just start dropping dead any minute .\nIf what you had was a plague .\nA biblical plague .\nSo that gives you a theory .\nActually two theories .\nThe first one \u2019 s wrong but really interesting , and I \u2019 ll wind up with the second , which is correct .\nM \u2019 colleague David Hardaker noted yesterday that the press corps still do not understand the degree to which Morrison \u2019 s actions were steered by his Pentecostalist Christian faith , and your correspondent was the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Morrison government was only weeks old .\nThey can not get into the mind of someone who was born into a family headed by a policeman/mayor/Pentecostalist preacher , and raised within it .\nPeople keep looking for a fake : it \u2019 s the prosperity gospel , they say , even though there \u2019 s very little of that in Morrison \u2019 s discourse .\nIt \u2019 s a put-on , to win seats .\nPentecostalism ?\nReally ?\nNo , Morrison \u2019 s faith is the real thing .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceit mingled with religiosity \u2014 that is simply because it \u2019 s not your Uniting Church-blue-skivvie-kumbaya sort of thing .\nPentecostalists and others draw a strong line between their faith and the fallen world .\nFor such Christians , trying to make the world behave better is a futile act .\nJudgment Day is coming , and your job is to bear witness of your faith , proselytise , and , if you \u2019 re prime minister of a prominent nation , steer the population to a safer place where they might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been initially sluggish as regards to COVID , come to believe that the plague was here ?\nTo ask if he might have believed it either literally or figuratively is to also impose a secular classification : if you think in mythical terms , then the plague may come clothed in the outer garment of a minor disease .\nYou have to be on the lookout for signs .\nHence the figure of \u201c the ship \u201d , \u201c the shore \u201d and \u201c the tempest \u201d , which Morrison has referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I was steering the ship in the tempest , while you were on the shore \u201d \u2014 he \u2019 s done about four variations of it .\nPartly , he \u2019 s still proselytising ; the art of that is to try and get someone when they \u2019 re at their most vulnerable , and ready for the word of God , and he may believe that the press corps is so demoralised that anything is possible .\nBut it \u2019 s also a picture of the world of his imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proximate image is of Jesus walking on the water to rescue his disciples in the tempest .\nThose standing \u201c on the shore \u201d are the doubters .\nThe miracle occurs just after the feeding of the five thousand , which occurs around the time of the Passover , and is taken as a passage from the salvation promise of the Old Testament to the New .\nUnder Passover only the Jews were saved ; under Christ all are saved , both strangers and friends .\nThe passage ( John 6:17-23 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Old Testament , in Isaiah , Job , and of course the Noah story .\nThe latter is significant because Noah is a steersman , a gubernator in Latin , or \u201c governor \u201d , as we say , and the rendering of leadership as steersmanship is common across all such cultures .\nHaving not been keen to acknowledge actual flooding and fires , Morrison appears to have taken to this third plague with the belief that he and only he could understand the challenge that was upon us now .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m not even going to point out that all five of his dual ministry appointments were made around the Passover/Easter period ( 14.3.2020 , 30.3.2020 , 15.4.2021 , 06.05.2021 ) , or that he doubled as his treasurer , Josh Frydenberg , on the day , according to the gospels of the Resurrection , which might damage my credibility a bit .\nWhat one can say is that anyone who was starting from a position of portents and signs of catastrophe , given only to him and obscure to those around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationality of the subsequent actions Morrison took .\nThe other theory ?\nScoMo is a completely rational actor to whom keeping a grip on the inner workings of the Liberal Party was more important than running the country .\nWhen COVID came along , it became clear that power would slip from the centre to specific ministries .\nThis would be worsened by the creation of the National Cabinet .\nFactional enemies would hold some of the levers .\nSo the additional secret ministries could act as a \u201c kill switch \u201d if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the cover of COVID to go rogue .\nThat \u2019 s how it rolled .\nC \u2019 mon .\nPortents in the heavens ?\nScoMo \u2019 s still a politician .\nOr was , at time of writing .", "author": "Guy Rundle", "url":

A constitutional expert weighs in", "content": "Scott Morrison \u2019 s various attempts to explain his multiple ministries have left more questions than answers .\nHere constitutional expert Professor Rosalind Dixon seeks to explain the ex-PM \u2019 s possible motivations .\nOne possibility is that Morrison genuinely felt afraid of what COVID might bring \u2014 and the capacity of the cabinet to step up to the challenge of managing the pandemic .\nMany of us in February and March 2020 experienced something like this feeling .\nI certainly bought a lot of ( though not more than my fair share of ) groceries , toilet paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my immuno-compromised parents .\nAnd to the consternation of colleagues , in February I started wearing an N95 mask .\nThis might also help explain Morrison \u2019 s first overlapping ministerial appointment \u2014 i.e .\nhis decision to appoint himself backup health minister in March 2020 .\nMorrison may not have needed to make this appointment .\nThere are already well-established paths for ministers to delegate their power to colleagues , in the event of illness or absence .\nAnd this is clearly what should have happened in this case .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acted in good faith in making this appointment .\nWe are also told that he informed Greg Hunt about the decision .\nThis is also why , earlier this week , I wrote an opinion piece that tried to credit the good faith of at least part of this version of events .\nBut for most subsequent appointments , the timing and secrecy of Morrison \u2019 s multiple roles just don \u2019 t fit with this account .\nAt a stretch , this might explain his decision to appoint himself as backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March 2020 .\nBut it is a real stretch .\nYou do not order emergency groceries and forget to tell the people they are designed to help .\nAnd it simply does not explain the actions he took in April and May 2021 , with the benefit of 12 months of pandemic management behind him .\nThe more likely explanation is that Morrison sought these appointments because he had a misguided view of how our constitutional system is supposed to operate : he saw the prime minister \u2019 s role as equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHis statement at his press conference yesterday was consistent with this view : he suggested that he was ultimately responsible to the Australian people for all aspects of pandemic management .\nThat may be true politically .\nBut it is not true legally .\nOur system of responsible government depends on individual and collective responsibility on the part of members of cabinet : ministers are individually responsible to Parliament for the performance of their ministries .\nAnd cabinet is responsible collectively for the performance of the government and maintaining the confidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , may simply have been spending a bit too much time talking to other presidents \u2014 and prime ministers with presidential tendencies .\nIn isolation , Morrison \u2019 s relationship with the likes of Narendra Modi , Shinzo Abe and Boris Johnson may have been good for Australia .\nBut the downside is that some of their centralising , presidentialist \u2014 indeed proto-authoritarian and nationalist \u2014 tendencies may have rubbed off on Morrison .\nAnd that is before he spent time with former US president Donald Trump .\nTrump was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who equated public , institutional power with personal power .\nHe saw no distinction between the White House and Mar-a-Lago , and classified public documents and his own tax returns .\nBoth were his personal enclaves .\nAnd it seems there is a good chance he squirrelled away or shredded both .\nHe also had no compunction inciting violence against members of Congress or his vice president to save his own position .\nInstitutions did not matter , only his own personal brand mattered .\nMorrison was a lot more restrained and pro-institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong personalist , ant-institutional vein .\nHe dismantled the Council of Australian Governments ( COAG ) in favour of a highly presidential form of national \u201c cabinet \u201d or committee that excluded many key cabinet colleagues at a state and federal level .\nHe downgraded the importance of institutions such as the Australian Public Service , and independent institutions such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal .\nAnd he thought it was enough to take the word of ministers such as Alan Tudge and Christian Porter about their conduct , rather than insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the importance of preserving public confidence in institutions such as the attorney-general .\nWhy this was so is anyone \u2019 s guess .\nMaybe Morrison \u2019 s remarkable success at the 2019 election , seizing victory from the jaws of defeat , went to his head .\nPerhaps being a Pentecostalist , a religion that emphasises individual charismatic authority , played some role .\nOr maybe Morrison is just something of a megalomaniac .\nWhatever the explanation , Australian voters can not accept Morrison \u2019 s attempt to justify his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary , secretive and in breach of basic commitments to responsible government and institutional checks and balances in our democracy .\nAnd we need consensus on that before we can move forward \u2014 because our system works well when these norms are upheld , but quite poorly otherwise .\nModest reforms should be adopted in Parliament to mandate that all ministries go on the legislative register , no matter how temporary .\nBut the biggest change we need is in how we talk about Morrison \u2019 s actions .\nIf not unconstitutional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our constitutional system .\nAnd there is simply no good reason for them ever to be repeated .", "author": "Rosalind Dixon", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/08/19/scott-morrison-understanding-expert-opinion/", "published": "Fri, 19 Aug 2022 06:23:30 +0000", "published_utc":

democracy through a violent invasion of Congress .\nIt was an insurrection , incited by Donald Trump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and police and has resulted , to date , in around 900 people being charged in relation to the attack .\nBut at the Murdoch family \u2019 s Fox News , things are very different .\nOn the day itself , the insurrection was repeatedly described as \u201c peaceful \u201d ; its \u201c energy \u201d and \u201c positivity \u201d were lauded by Fox personalities .\nAs Trump supporters breached the building , one Fox host said , \u201c This is a huge victory for these protesters .\nThey have disrupted the system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c peaceful protest \u201d line became increasingly difficult to maintain , Fox News personalities began comparing the insurrection to Black

.\n\u201c You can dismiss them as crazy , call them conspiracy theorists , kick them off Twitter , that won \u2019 t change their minds.\n\u201d Others claimed left-wing protesters had infiltrated the insurrection and turned it violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congressional inquiry into the events of that day unearthed the role of Donald Trump earlier this year , detailing planning that went into the

@ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s lies about a stolen election .\nBut rarely has the network seemed so utterly committed to total disinformation as when its presenters have insisted nothing happened that day , and that anything that did happen was the fault not of those who perpetrated the deaths , the violence and the political disruption , but of politicians , of apparently ninja-like \u201c antifa \u201d subversives , of those who ran the protests as a supposed false-flag operation .\nTo understand the events of January 6 it \u2019 s crucial to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifying the Big Lie .\nTo understand the ongoing hold Donald Trump has on the Republican Party , it \u2019 s necessary to understand the continuing role of Fox News in feeding lies and propaganda to his supporters .\nAnd to understand that role requires understanding those who control Fox News \u2014 the Murdoch family .\nTo suggest that either the Murdochs do not have some responsibility for the events of January 6 , or that making that suggestion should be punished in court , is an extraordinary denial of the public interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now pursuing in the Federal Court .\nThis is a matter of the highest public

.\nThe return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of Fox News \u2014 can not be dismissed .\nThe election of a Trump-like figure of authoritarian populism like Ron DeSantis can not be dismissed .\nAll would be alarming outcomes for Australia , given our lead role in taking on China in our own region .\nAll would undermine our security .\nAll would imperil the assumptions at the heart of our defence

the motion could pass the House of Representatives , stating that the chamber agrees to support an inquiry .\nBut that won \u2019 t generate an actual inquiry \u2014 at best the government might agree

coverage after the 2020 US presidential election until the January 6 insurrection .\nAs Fox News might say : \u201c We report .\nYou decide.\n\u201d \u201c In a lot of ways , what happened Tuesday night could not have been worse for this country or its future .\nThe outcome of our presidential election was seized from the hands of voters , where it rightly belongs , and now resides in the control of lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly corrupt big city bureaucrats .\nNo matter what happens next , that is a tragedy .\nMany Americans will never again accept the results of a presidential election.\n\u201d \u201c We are at the beginning of the second presidential campaign of 2020 .\nJust as Andrew Jackson responded to the corrupt bargain of 1824 by tearing apart the establishment and winning the presidency in 1828 , just as Abraham Lincoln rejected the threats of the slave-owning Democrats and insisted on preserving the union in 1860 , I think the millions and millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who formed boat parades \u2014 and Arizona formed a 96-mile-long parade of Trump supporters \u2014 I think as they watch Joe Biden \u2019 s Democratic Party steal the election in Philadelphia , steal the election in Atlanta , steal the election in Milwaukee , I think the more information that comes out , the greater the rage is going to be .\n\u201c President Trump is going to be forced by his own supporters and by the objective reality of the truth , the facts that are beginning to come out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly like Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln .\nHe either has to fight and protect America , or he has to surrender to corrupt sources , starting with the Biden family corruption spreading out to the corruption of the Democratic machines , going on to the corruption of places like The New York Times.\n\u201d \u201c On election night , early returns showed that the president has a significant lead in the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania .\nTwo days later , we are still counting votes and awaiting the results in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of different states shut down voting on election night ?\n\u201d \u201c As of tonight , tens of millions of Americans suspect this election was stolen from them .\nThat means we now live in a country where a large percentage of our population no longer believes that our democracy is real .\nThat is sad .\nIt is also dangerous ; it could easily get worse.\n\u201d \u201c 70 % of Republicans feel like the presidential election was neither free nor fair , according to a new morning consult political poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % believe mass mail-in voting led to widespread fraud .\n72 % of that group thinks the ballots were tampered with .\nNevertheless , Biden is pretending that the election has been certified and that all legal challenges have been resolved.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s been more than a week since the final votes were cast and many of Donald Trump \u2019 s 72 million voters still believe this election was fundamentally unfair .\nThey \u2019 re right about that .\nDemocrats completely changed the way we voted in this election .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it \u2019 s never been more vulnerable to manipulation.\n\u201d \u201c Many Americans do not believe that this election was fair .\nAnd make no mistake : every American has a right to feel that way .\nI feel that way .\nIt \u2019 s a corrupt and embarrassing disgrace , we , you , the American people , deserve more .\nWe are capable of so much more.\n\u201d \u201c I am working on the massive aspect of system-wide election fraud definitely impacting the swing states and likely going far beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alteration and changes and millions of votes , some being dumped that were for president Trump , some being flipped that were for president Trump .\nComputers being overwritten to ignore signatures , all kinds of different means of manipulating the Dominion and Smartmatic software , that of course , we would not expect Dominion or Smartmatic to admit.\n\u201d \u201c President Trump won by not just hundreds of thousands of votes , but by millions of votes , that were shifted by this software that was designed expressly for that purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the software was designed .\nIt was designed to rig elections .\nHe was fully briefed on it .\nHe saw it happen in other countries.\n\u201d \u201c The president has all this support , all the 73 million people that voted for him , in light of the demonisation of him for four years , I just find it hard to believe .\nI really do .\nI \u2019 m not saying that conspiratorially .\nAnd when you look at the major metropolitan areas like Milwaukee , like Detroit , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pause in the voting that you made reference to , there \u2019 s shenanigans going on .\nAnd the president \u2019 s doing a service by highlighting how dangerous the idea of ubiquitous mail-in ballots with no accountability and no voter ID and no voter signature .\nYou can drive a truck through these election results and future election results , which is bad for all of us .\nI don \u2019 t like where it stands right now .\nIt \u2019 s just \u2014 so much in it stinks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of this country haven \u2019 t gone away .\nThere \u2019 s still a lot of anger out there about the fact that there were widespread irregularities in the select number of states .\nYou know , they \u2019 re boarding up windows , not letting poll watchers watch what \u2019 s going on , even though the state laws say that .\nAnd then they wonder why people question the results or the integrity of the process.\n\u201d \u201c We have a lot of people who are dead who didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey got mail-in ballots .\nThey filled out mail-in ballots .\nThey sent mail-in ballots into the election places and actually cast votes as dead people .\nAnd I think that \u2019 s what we are now discovering is wrong with a lot of these polls .\nI guess they should have surveyed more dead people because it seems like they were pretty active this past election.\n\u201d \u201c You know , the whole mail \u2014 this whole mail thing was really done so they could steal the election .\nThey knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He destroyed them at the ballot box on Tuesday.\n\u201d \u201c The dishonesty is brazen and you can begin to understand why so many Americans have lost their faith in our institutions , including in our elections .\nWhy ?\nBecause the people managing them are dishonest and incompetent.\n\u201d \u201c We \u2019 ve got to continue fighting this , and the federal courts are the path and , hopefully , up to the Supreme Court , because voter fraud is real , and they seized on a pandemic and created an electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system that should never have happened.\n\u201d \u201c My lawsuit proves to have it deemed unconstitutional and unlawful , and they \u2019 re going to have to figure out a way to have a new down ballot vote and the electors and the legislature will have to select the president of the United States , which I \u2019 m confident will be Donald Trump .\nHe won this election by record landslide across the nation .\nThey stole \u2014 they tried to steal this election , judge , and now they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 2020 presidential election was not fair , and no honest person would claim that it was .\nThe system was rigged against one candidate and in favour of another , and not in ways that were hidden from view.\n\u201d \u201c All I can say is I haven \u2019 t heard , with all of the fraud that \u2019 s taken place , nobody has come to me and said , \u2018 Oh , the FBI has nabbed , you know , the people that are doing this game .\nThe FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody even knows where they \u2019 re based , which nobody even knows where the votes are counted .\nWhat \u2019 s going on in this country is not to be believed.\n\u201d \u201c Well , you \u2019 ve heard a lot of allegations of high-tech fraud in last month \u2019 s election : people messing with the software , putting unauthorised thumb drives , etc , but maybe not enough about low-tech fraud , traditional fraud .\nThere \u2019 s evidence there was quite a bit of that.\n\u201d \u201c Most Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as 80 % , say they see fraud in this recent election .\nTonight one thing is very clear .\nIf we don \u2019 t fix what is a broken , corrupt election system , the country is in deep trouble.\n\u201d \u201c We are not dumb .\nWe \u2019 re not blind .\nWe can see the entire thing stinks to high heaven \u2026 We know that very specific election laws \u2026 were totally and completely and utterly ignored [ in ] Georgia , Pennsylvania , many other battleground states .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ things on their own.\n\u201d \u201c We \u2019 ll preview the march for Trump rally that is set to take place this Wednesday .\nThousands and thousands of Americans planning to hit the streets in our nation \u2019 s capital demand election accountability .\nNow this comes as Senator Ted Cruz is leading what is a growing effort to officially challenge the electoral college results on the very same day \u2026 That is Ted Cruz , Senator Josh Hawley , at least 10 other senators joining now over 140 House lawmakers demanding what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from states with serious voting irregularities .\nThis is an important , this is a critical , this is a necessary step in an election that is clearly wrought with serious issues.\n\u201d \u201c We will make sure in the coming weeks , months , and years , that Americans know who lied to them and what they did and when they did it and , when we needed the truth most , who denied it.\n\u201d \u201c If they truly believe this election was absolutely done with integrity , then they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting that there be a full audit .\nThe unreasonable part is that the press has pretended that there is no evidence [ of election fraud ] \u2026 That \u2019 s simply a lie .\nThere is evidence and that \u2019 s what hasn \u2019 t been looked at .\n\u201d", "author": "Keir Semmens", "url":

It\u2019s in for the long haul", "content": "Well that was quick .\nA chorus of voices arose to suggest , demand , plead that the Morrison government \u2019 s stage three tax cuts be put on hold or cancelled by the Albanese government in commitment to its progressive roots .\nThen Anthony Albanese said no , it won \u2019 t be doing that .\nAnd really , that was that .\nThere \u2019 ll be a bit more nibbling at it , but it \u2019 s over .\nThe rather odd sally in favour by veteran Liberal MP Russell Broadbent to cancel the cuts he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip for this issue .\nLabor would be committing political self-harm of the first order by cancelling or even modifying the stage three cuts .\nIt waved them through when they were brought to Parliament in 2019 ( something your correspondent argued in favour of ) in order to not get snarled on the issue .\nPolitically , in pursuit of a Labor majority , it was absolutely right to do so .\nHad it not done so , its opposition to the cuts may well have been the means by which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having lost in 2019 partly due to the franking credits stuff up , it was leaving nothing to chance .\nThe decision , and its ramifications , indicates where we are all at , what Labor is now , and what \u2019 s possible .\nSpoiler alert : not much .\nYep , the stage three cuts are a boondoggle , no doubt about it .\nCreating one huge tax bracket from $ 45k to $ 200k , and lowering base rate from 32.5 % to 30 % , is an absurdly inelastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation .\nBut its purpose , when first proposed , was political rather than economic .\nThe giveaway to the higher third of that bracket above $ 150,000 is galling , to say the least .\nBut the bracket shift at the lower end responded to a form of \u201c bracket creep \u201d , occurring because working-class and middle-class jobs \u2014 construction , electrical , nursing , teaching \u2014 were starting to earn some big bucks , a result of strong unions and the creation of professional strata within the occupations .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120k , and construction and other trades are heading to $ 150k , the existing brackets were becoming punitive to working-class prosperity .\nThere hasn \u2019 t been much acknowledgment of this in progressive discourse .\nInstead there has been an implicit and explicit call to focus tax policy around collective commitment and the common good , even if that meant self-sacrifice from wage earners who might otherwise benefit directly from the cuts .\nBut that is a typically progressivist stance , validated as moral action and reaffirming progressivism as an identity .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ never charity ; it was the advancement of humanity through the advancement of the class .\nThe lower- and mid-range of the stage three tax cuts do that : return money to people in occupations that did not expect to enjoy such income levels .\nTo simply dismiss that as \u201c selfishness \u201d , as some progressives do , is a blinkered approach to what these new wage levels have meant , individually and socially .\nThey may well apply to a minority within such occupations , but they offer the opportunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a two-income working-class or working-middle-class couple could be making some serious money simply by staying in the occupation they have \u2014 rather than having to transfer into management , to which there is a substantial , and policed , class barrier .\nThat not only offers a new present prosperity , but also a greater opportunity for intergenerational wealth transfer within these occupations .\nThere hasn \u2019 t exactly been an outcry against the tax cuts from this sector of society .\nThe refusal to see this aspect of the tax cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time when the working class was a more unified thing , but unified by modest wages and ceilings on their rise .\nThe division now runs through the working class , since the interests of asset-holding , high-wage people are contrary to the low-waged and benefits recipients .\nSecond , it \u2019 s a nostalgia for the Whitlamite era , when we were on the road , or trying to be , to a social democracy \u2014 in which individual and family good were bound up with common good , universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state .\nBut that possibility is gone now , and it \u2019 s been gone for some time .\nIt only really existed for a few decades after World War II , and it was decisively killed by a series of Hawke-Keating initiatives .\nThe triple whammy of extension to negative gearing , the privatisations of public service utilities in the early 1990s , and the focusing of life-course management on superannuation made us ( back ) into a country focused on individual family welfare management .\nThe steady undermining of Medicare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard onwards have only served to emphasise and increase that .\nThe roots of such social familialism are deep in our history , running down to the Harvester judgment of 1907 , and there was only one brief chance , post World War II , to convert to a more European social democracy , and we didn \u2019 t make it .\nNow most Australians look out over a social landscape in which the long journey of self and family life must be managed as an individual .\nThat is a tough terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy civilisation \u201d argument , especially when people can see corporations paying no taxes at all .\nIt \u2019 s to the difficult task of taxing corporations better that progressives should look .\nThat \u2019 s not going to break Labor \u2019 s promise of \u201c no new taxes \u201d \u2014 call \u2019 em levies \u2014 and corporations have no friends .\nThe task of clawing back money from corporations as they siphon it out of everyday life will be the major challenge of the near future .\nLet \u2019 s face it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back on the cuts .\nIt would get the Coalition back into the game in an instant .\nAt the moment , it can languish indefinitely .\nLabor has its eyes on the prize now : a decade in power , with the foundations laid in the first 18 months of this government .\nSteady , unhurried , thoughtful , modest policymaking and implementation , aimed squarely at the asset-owning working and middle classes , and resisting calls to extend much more than basic consideration to welfare recipients , refugees , First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt will aim to show capital that it can integrate the competing sectors , together with labour and environmental demands , to create a smooth and dependable framework for accumulation .\nIt will show the labour movement it can deliver steady improvements , without for a moment offering to change the system that locks workers and unions out of actual self-representation .\nIt is essentially turning itself into a conservative government .\nThe \u201c Menzies spirit \u201d that the freak show on the right goes on about , waving the \u201c forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be with Labor , and personified by Albanese .\nAlbo waving from the balcony at a Gang of Youths concert is like Our Sir Robert waving his sun hat for the cameras from the members stand during the Fourth Test .\nIt shows a man at home in his own skin among his own people in his own time .\nThe right will respond by trying to get Peta Credlin elected .\nBut this political-cultural centrality was only won by breaking decisively with cultural progressivism .\nThe long Labor-progressive alliance ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLabor will land squarely where the general public is , and that \u2019 s sometimes basically , and in a very limited way , progressive \u2014 the Voice , same-sex marriage \u2014 and sometimes not .\nThose who want to get a progressive agenda up , or merely visible , have relatively few options capable of breaking through .\nJoin the Greens , or a party further left , start a minimal program populist party \u2014 the Low Income People \u2019 s Party , or the Party of the Poor \u2014 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOr join Labor and begin the long insurgency to reset its policies .\nYou first .\nPeople will need to kick the sort of illusions that have propelled this somewhat plaintive go on the stage three tax cuts .\nSome believe the government is using the pressure build-up to look as if its hand is forced before cancelling the cuts .\nI will be truly astounded if that happens and will admit my error .\nStill , I think Labor \u2019 s honeymoon is not over ( desperate hope of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTime to brush off the confetti and commit to the long disappointment .\nFrom now on , the only banging on offer will be the freezing of the pipes in winter .", "author": "Guy Rundle", "url":

Indigenous Voice to be enshrined in the constitution , and then \u2014 as a \u201c culmination \u201d \u2014 a Makarrata Commission \u201c to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history \u201d .\nThe Greens decided last year that this was wrong , and that instead \u201c the establishment of a Truth and Justice Commission is one of this country \u2019 s first priorities \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament and/or government \u201d appears almost as an afterthought in its \u201c Truth , Treaty , Voice \u201d

@ , again indicating just how low a priority a Voice referendum is for the Greens .\nThat leaves the Greens now looking as though they \u2019 ll align with far-right fringe dwellers like One Nation , and racist dead-enders in the Coalition , in opposing a Voice referendum \u2014 with a more hardline position that the opposition , which is yet to formally oppose it .\nAnd Thorpe has made clear either way that the Greens will not be supporting a referendum in 2023 , saying the government is \u201c kidding themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a referendum next year \u201d .\nGiven Greens \u2019 support in the Senate will be required for the referendum if the Coalition blocks it , it could spell the end of any hope for a referendum happening in this term \u2014 leaving Indigenous recognition yet again to be put off , well into the second decade after it was first agreed by both sides of politics .\nGreens Leader Adam Bandt says the Greens are still committed to \u201c good faith \u201d negotiations on the referendum , but that statement appears fundamentally at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there \u2019 s no point to a referendum , that money shouldn \u2019 t be wasted on it , and that it won \u2019 t happen next year anyway \u2014 before we even get the Greens \u2019 policy position that the Voice is an afterthought .\nIt does however raise the serious question of what support Bandt can deliver if he decides to back a referendum .\nHow many senators will he be able to count on in a party where the leader is so profoundly at odds with the relevant opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divided party where his own senators contradict him ?\nFor every Greens senator that refuses to support a referendum , the government will have to find another vote to establish a referendum at all .\nFacing the possible refusal of the Greens to even permit a referendum to happen , the only upside for Labor is that the Greens are thus handing Labor a useful weapon in the 2025 election .\nIn every

Statement from the Heart is the only way forward\u00a0for meaningful change", "content": "Eddie Synot is a Wamba Wamba First Nations lawyer and researcher with Griffith Law School , Griffith University and a centre associate with the Indigenous Law Centre , UNSW .\nHe is also a member of the Uluru Dialogue .\nMovements for change often face a chasm between the conviction of their followers and a future we never arrive at because we lack credible and achievable ways to get there .\nEven when we respond to the worst parts of our society with the best of intentions , movements for change often mirror negative aspects of our politics that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHere , too , prevailing structures of power are not easily transformed , and organising for change is made that much harder by the very interests that serve and benefit from them .\nThe place of First Nations is no exception .\nFor 233 years the rights of First Nations peoples have been denied , and this denial has touched all aspects of First Nations \u2019 lives .\nFirst Nations have not simply felt this denial as a lack of formal recognition , easily rectified by formalistic , symbolic gestures such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNone of the decisions of the Commonwealth , states and territories , or broader institutions of Australian society , such as Closing the Gap or any other targeted reform , have occurred in a vacuum disconnected from this denial .\nThe length of this denial also means we are 233 years into a complicated relationship .\nWe are dealing with a deeply embedded legal and political system that is not easily changed , so too Australian cultural norms .\nFirst Nations have not ceded their sovereignty , but Australia \u2019 s legitimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps not moral \u2014 entity does not depend on whether it has a treaty with First Nations .\nEven the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People ( UNDRIP ) does not change this .\nArticle 46 , often ignored by many that rely on UNDRIP to inform their claims against the Australian state , declares that nothing in UNDRIP \u201c may be interpreted as implying\u2026 any action which would dismember or impair , totally or in part , the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent states \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth will remain the paramount legal authority .\nEven future treaties will be susceptible to Parliament and could be torn up , leaving \u2014 in the absence of a constitutionally protected Voice \u2014 nothing .\nSome refuse to accept this .\nTheir solutions should be understood in the context of their refusal to engage these challenges .\nThe Uluru Statement from the Heart was developed through a process that understood these challenges .\nThirteen regional dialogues , run over three days each , engaged a representative cross-section of the Indigenous community through informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple consultations .\nThese deliberations countenanced broad views from the Indigenous community , including dissent , and resulted in the First Nations National Constitutional Convention in 2017 .\nThere , an overwhelming majority of delegates endorsed the consensus position of the Uluru Statement and the sequenced reforms of Voice , Treaty and Truth .\nThese reforms provide a credible and achievable way forward .\nThe Uluru Statement changes are grounded in the legitimate rights of First Nations .\nThey are also informed by the reality of the Australian state .\nThis means delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention understood the difference between credible , achievable change as opposed to ideal , impossible constitutional amendments and reforms , each more impossible \u2014 legally and politically \u2014 to achieve than the last .\nThis is one reason why the Voice enshrined in the constitution was the first preference for change of regional and national delegates in the sequenced order of Voice , Treaty and Truth .\nThe order of Voice first followed by a Makarrata Commission for agreement-making and truth-telling was not forced on delegates .\nIt can not just be dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the result of informed , deliberative dialogue where delegates wanted their voices to be heard , and for that structural change to inform future processes of agreement-making ( treaty ) and truth-telling .\nMisinformation about this process continues , however .\nSome deny First Nations \u2019 rights , claiming the Voice is a \u201c race-based \u201d body based on inequality and division .\nThese arguments would have us practise a terra nullius writ large and should be treated as belonging to the bygone age they do .\nOthers refuse to recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming also the Voice would be powerless , and treaty should come first .\nNeither position engages responsibly with the reality of our situation nor of achieving change .\nIt is impossible First Nations accept they don \u2019 t exist , just as it is impossible to ignore the reality of the Australian state and the position of First Nations within it .\nYet political impossibilities have not stopped many exploring the chasm between personal preference , ideal and reality , while also making mountains out of molehills \u2014 such as the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Voice \u2014 while pushing their preference .\nHere expertise counts for little when the commentariat \u2014 and others \u2014 are all too ready to assume the position of the all-knowing polymath .\nThe claim the Voice will have no power is especially disingenuous when made by those that claim there isn \u2019 t enough detail .\nHow would they know ?\nThe point about power is na\u00efve also because nothing , not even a treaty , can have , share , or replace the power of the Australian Parliament .\nClaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations of our legal and political system that can not be changed in the same way other constitutional amendments are made .\nNo reform is going to change this fundamental structure other than an absolute upheaval , which is neither desirable nor on the agenda .\nThe truth is the Voice will not be powerless .\nIt has been developed with all this in mind .\nThe Voice will be a powerful and permanent institution for First Nations to mobilise around , to be recognised and represented by , and to influence Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Voice that changes to the Australian culture and power of decision-making will occur to enable better outcomes as well as meaningful agreement-making and truth-telling .\nCould we really expect that from current structures ?\nThe Uluru delegates understood we can \u2019 t .\nDespite claims here too about there not being enough detail , the Voice is a simple , principled reform that has been detailed .\nIt \u2019 s also a disingenuous claim .\nAustralians vote every federal election to confer authority on Parliament to act on our behalf , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with little to no detail of Parliament \u2019 s intentions .\nYet now , suddenly , we are to believe the Australian public is a nation of policy wonks who must know the intimate detail of every decision Parliament intends to make before we vote .\nOur political system has never worked that way , nor could it .\nReforms could never ever be allowed that would limit Parliament \u2019 s power in such a way .\nThe fact is , the Voice has been developed through the most extensive process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , conducted over decades , has canvassed all the issues many fixate on .\nThe detailed work has been done where it is needed .\nThe accessibility of that detail , whether it is about the constitutional amendment itself as opposed to the future legislative model of a Voice ( which is not needed ) is another matter entirely and one that will be addressed through the course of the referendum .\nThis is a reform about first principles : there will be a Voice ( because there should be ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it should as a matter of right and best practice ) ; Parliament will have power over its make-up and powers ( because that is how our constitutional system works ) .\nIf we aren \u2019 t happy with the Voice , we can organise to change it .\nIt is on us to make it work .\nThere are no easy answers , but the Voice is the mechanism for us to make real , lasting change .\nThe Voice \u2019 s fundamental existence as a matter of principle between First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain .\nThe Voice would provide a permanent , authoritative institution to negotiate the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians .\nFinally , after 233 years , we would be taking a substantive step forward .\nFirst Nations would be recognised and respected and decisions would no longer be made without them .\nNot even treaty can guarantee that .\nDoes the prospect of an Indigenous Voice to Parliament fill you with pride ?\nLet us know your thoughts by writing to letters @

video platform Rumble sent it to No .\n1 one on the Apple and Google app stores .\nSo who are Tate \u2019 s fans ?\nAnd do they represent a broader wellspring of bigotry ?\nIt \u2019 s hard to get reliable data on Tate \u2019 s audience because many of his videos were uploaded from an opaque network of fan accounts .\nBut he recently described his fans as predominantly young .\nJordan Peterson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary \u201c guru \u201d , initially described his online audience as \u201c 80 % male \u201d and skewing young , though he now claims it has diversified .\nYoung people tend to be more left-leaning than older generations .\nBut there is evidently a cohort of young men who are receptive to right-wing \u2014 and specifically anti-feminist \u2014 commentary .\nResearch suggests this online \u201c manosphere \u201d thrives on social isolation , which has risen significantly among young men .\nContent creators like Tate seek to convert it into resentment of others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this \u201c angry young men \u201d cohort ?\nAnd do its views just manifest online , or does it translate to the ballot box ?\nResearch presented at a recent Macquarie University seminar , using data for the Australian Cooperative Election Survey , clarifies these questions in the Australian context .\nIt showed young men and women are more starkly divided on gender issues than older generations .\nThis is partly because older women have more socially conservative views compared with younger women , putting them closer to men their age .\nConversely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas by some measures the average young man is actually more conservative on gender issues than his father \u2019 s or grandfather \u2019 s generation .\nThe data also showed a greater gender split among young people \u2019 s votes in the May federal election .\nOlder people of these two genders tended to vote similarly , and more conservatively , as they aged .\nYoung men were more likely to vote Labor than older men , but young women did so in noticeably greater numbers .\nThere was also a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not precisely clear whether the gender split among young people on social issues and voting is related .\nBut a key event in former prime minister Scott Morrison \u2019 s tenure \u2014 Brittany Higgins \u2019 rape allegations \u2014 show it might have been a factor .\nWomen voters moved significantly towards Labor in the aftermath .\n\u201c Young women I wouldn \u2019 t say were radicalised , but definitely politicised , \u201d said gender expert Michelle Arrow , who worked on the research .\n\u201c But for men , [ their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much .\nThe debate Higgins and [ Grace ] Tame started was about male behaviour .\nI wonder if that left many young men feeling uncomfortable or even personally implicated.\n\u201d Other possible explanations are income and education .\n\u201c This also reflects a reconfiguration of who Labor \u2019 s core constituency is , \u201d Arrow said .\n\u201c The majority of university students are now women , and more jobs now require university credentials .\nBut the main ones that don \u2019 t , but still provide a ticket to good incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male dominated \u2014 and which have become more entrepreneurial.\n\u201d Increasingly , young women are more strongly invested in their labour , which aligns their interests with left-leaning , pro-worker parties .\n\u201c We saw this in the way the parties crafted their images , \u201d Arrow said .\n\u201c A lot of Morrison \u2019 s image was around the tradie , who is an aspirational figure for many young men .\nContrast that with Albanese , who was interviewed by Grace Tame in InStyle magazine and forefronted the care industries.\n\u201d This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYoung Americans are also politically divided by gender .\nShaun Wilson , another academic who worked on the research , cautioned against over-extrapolating the data : \u201c Young men are still majority left-leaning , partly due to economic issues .\nBut there is a curious persistence of conflict over gender roles that is not necessarily increasing but not going away either.\n\u201d Diverging social views suggest cultural reactionaries like Tate are succeeding in courting the young male demographic .\nTheir success online might not yet be flowing through to the ballot box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clearly political \u2014 Tate has hung out with far-right UK politician Nigel Farage , for instance .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a pretty disturbing picture around the world , \u201d Arrow said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re seeing the radicalisation of many young men .\nFigures like Donald Trump and the far right are looking to young men much more than young women.\n\u201d For those of us committed

backed away from funding his favoured charity ?\nThe Australian Future Leaders Foundation ( AFLF ) might have been well intentioned \u2014 aimed as it was at creating a network for young Australian achievers \u2014 but it reeked of the monarchy .\nThere is ample evidence that the foundation , proposed by people with links to the royal family and promoted by the queen \u2019 s representative in Australia , received special treatment from Scott Morrison , whose government was prepared to back it with $ 18 million and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always out of kilter with Australia in 2022 .\nFor months the funding decision sat there as just another example of Morrison \u2019 s trademark abuse of process .\nBut that all changed with revelations of Morrison \u2019 s secret ministries , signed off by Governor-General David Hurley .\nThat raised a perception that the prime minister and the governor-general gave special treatment to each other .\n( The G-G \u2019 s office has firmly rejected the allegation . )\nThe grant is gone , but we are left with a host of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the incumbent governor-general but also for his office .\nProponents of the AFLF were able to gain the kind of access to the governor-general \u2019 s office that other charities would kill for .\nThe record shows there were a dozen meetings between the G-G \u2019 s office and the foundation \u2019 s executive director , upper-crust Englishman Chris Hartley .\nThat then translated into access to the Prime Minister \u2019 s Office as the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet took the running on backing Hartley \u2019 s regal idea with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week , the governor-general was ultimately in the position of signing into law two legislative amendments that had been passed specifically for the benefit of the AFLF .\nOne was to enable the payment of $ 18 million ( with a guarantee of more ) and the other was for the much coveted Deductible Gift Recipient tax status .\nThese conflicts are separate from the perceived conflict of Scott Morrison , the prime minister of the day , overseeing the funding of a charity promoted by the governor-general .\nThe legislation enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation describes it as \u201c an initiative of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in consultation with the Office of the Official Secretary of the Governor-General \u201d , a description that places it perilously close to being a joint venture .\nDoes this not , in theory , compromise the independence of the G-G \u2019 s office ?\nTruth to be told , what are the connections ?\nCitizen journalists who go by the Twitter names Ronni Salt and Jommy Tee have produced deep research showing a series of interactions between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the suggestion that their relationship is more than portrayed in Senate estimates hearings earlier this year .\nThis may or may not be the case , but it does call for an answer .\nThere are also the ties that bind Chris Hartley LVO and the secretary of the governor-general , Paul Singer MVO .\nSinger is a former officer in the Royal Australian Navy .\nRelevantly for this saga , Singer is an alumnus of CSCLeaders , a program for Commonwealth leaders .\nChris Hartley is listed as a non-executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order , a royal honour he was granted in 2016 .\nHartley received his royal honour in 2000 .\nThe actions of the governor-general and his office may not be illegal , but they are a bad look .\nOn another level , the foundation saga also represents yet another chapter in the former Coalition government \u2019 s assaults on the integrity of government institutions .\nThe Coalition destroyed the independence of the AAT by stacking it with political mates .\nIt routinely appointed political friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the governor-general , the Coalition used the Order of Australia awards relentlessly to stack the awards body and to reward its political friends with honours , rubber-stamped by the G-G .\nUltimately Scott Morrison believed it was totally acceptable to use the G-G \u2019 s office to give himself more and more power , not even bothering to front up to the governor-general in person , so disdainful did he become .\nSolicitor-General Stephen Donaghue found that Morrison \u2019 s actions with respect to the G-G were legal but breached \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are calls for the governor-general to step down or to explain himself more fully .\nAt the very least the net result is that the office of the governor-general has

Why then should we trust his secret $170bn submarine deal?", "content": "This is part one of an ongoing investigative series by David Hardaker .\nIt was a year ago this week that Scott Morrison appeared alongside Boris Johnson and Joe Biden to unveil the AUKUS security pact which would bind Australia , the UK and the US for decades .\nAfter years of work in the background , Morrison \u2019 s secret weapon was finally ready .\nAUKUS is the largest commitment to defence spending Australia has ever made \u2014 about $ 170 billion , according to the latest estimate from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute .\nAt a single stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d pact with the Anglosphere powers , blindsided France , and ambushed the Labor opposition .\nUntil that moment Australia had only one nuclear reactor , at Lucas Heights in Sydney .\nSuddenly it was signing up for eight more in the form of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines .\nFor this there was no consultation .\nNo white papers .\nNo parliamentary debate .\nIt was just Morrison , apparently acting alone and in secret \u2014 a modus operandi which has defined his career stretching all the way back to his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of that have been disastrous before .\nMight it be different this time ?\nTwelve months on Crikey is taking a look inside the AUKUS deal , how it began and where it is going .\nIt is for the moment a partial picture because so little detail has been released .\nWe will report more over the coming months .\nBut one thing is sure .\nWhatever the strategic value of AUKUS it bears the indelible mark of Liberal politics .\nFrom Morrison in Canberra to former attorney-general George Brandis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , the deal \u2014 enormous as it is \u2014 has been a one-party affair .\nHow fortuitous for Morrison that Australia \u2019 s London and Washington diplomatic posts were occupied by former Liberal politicians given his determination to keep AUKUS secret from the Labor opposition .\nWhether or not it is all in the national interest is almost impossible to know yet .\nSo when and why did Morrison decide to overturn the applecart ?\nWe have only one AUKUS creation story to go on : the one brought to us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson and Geoff Chambers , who were given special access to Morrison for their book Plagued .\nAccording to Benson and Chambers , Morrison \u2019 s lightbulb moment occurred around September 2019 in the weeks after he attended the G7 summit in the French coastal hamlet of Biarritz .\nIt was then he began \u201c turning his mind to submarines \u201d .\n\u201c Poring over the defence contracts that Australia had signed up to , the prime minister wanted to assure himself that there would be no regrets in the $ 90bn French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 , \u201d they wrote .\nAs prime minister , Morrison liked to be photographed as the lonely leader , carrying the weight of office and the nation \u2019 s future on his shoulders .\nHere was a word picture to match his Churchillian self-image .\nThe problem is : how to trust the story ?\nMorrison \u2019 s propensity for myth-making invites speculation as to what really happened .\nDid a crow perch on the balcony thus reminding the prime minister of a biblical exhortation to act ?\nWas it one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former US secretary of state , the ever-belligerent-towards-China Mike Pompeo ?\nA long-time Canberra Defence strategist put it politely to Crikey that our imaginings were off the mark .\nMorrison , he said , was very aware of the growing China threat from his years in cabinet .\nAnd the idea of nuclear submarines had been kicking around Canberra for years , as a dream made impossible due to the US refusal to share its nuclear secrets with anyone beyond the UK .\nSo who was Morrison \u2019 s first confidant ?\nAccording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his senior defence adviser , Jimmy Kiploks , to make discreet enquiries with senior Defence officials as to the possibility of Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines .\nAnd who is Kiploks ?\nIt will surprise approximately no one to learn that he was a Liberal Party member , with records from 2010 showing him atop the ACT branch of the Liberal Party , where he was aligned with the conservative Zed Seselja ( later a Morrison government minister ) .\nBut Crikey has found more buried deep in the archives of Adelaide University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back in his student days the young Kiploks ran for election on a stridently pro-gambling platform .\nDeclaring himself a member of the Skycity Adelaide casino action club , Kiploks vowed to \u201c fight for pokies , Keno , TAB and a casino on campus \u201d .\nMaybe it was all just student hijinks ( Kiploks hasn \u2019 t responded to our attempts to contact him ) but the pro-gambling , conservative Liberal branch politician must have been pinching himself when he was later in the presence of POTUS himself as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Quad powers at the Biden White House .\nPerhaps the key player in Morrison \u2019 s inner circle , though , has been Andrew Shearer , the head of the Office of National Intelligence ( ONI ) , whose rise in Canberra has been closely tied to conservative Liberal governments .\nShearer \u2019 s Canberra career has seen him on the staff of former Liberal defence minister Robert Hill , as well as adviser to prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott \u2014 though not Malcolm Turnbull .\n( Shearer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with France \u2019 s Naval Group over Japan . )\nShearer \u2019 s conservative pedigree includes time as a CD Kemp Fellow at the conservative Melbourne policy group the Institute of Public Affairs .\nMorrison appointed him as cabinet secretary in August 2019 , just weeks before his lightbulb moment on the AUKUS subs deal .\nA year later Morrison appointed Shearer to run the ONI , a role which gave him almost daily access to the prime minister for security briefings .\nMorrison made the appointment over Labor \u2019 s objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d who reportedly did not have their confidence .\nToo bad .\nThe ONI job is a statutory appointment , so there \u2019 s nothing the Albanese government can do about it until Shearer \u2019 s term expires in 2025 .\nIt has to live with it \u2014 or work around it \u2014 like the other partisan appointments in the federal government .\nEvidence given to parliamentary committees late last year began to fill in the gaps on who knew what and when of the emerging plan to dump the French deal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one .\nSenate committee evidence shows that the circle widened first to secretary of Defence Greg Moriarty and Defence Force chief Angus Campbell , who scoped out possibilities from around March-April 2020 .\nThis was around the time that Morrison had \u201c begun the process of abandoning \u201d the French subs deal , according to the version Morrison gave to The Australian Financial Review .\nBy December 2020 Defence had reported its findings to Morrison .\nIt was only then that Morrison \u2019 s department head , Phil Gaetjens , was brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a further six months , in June 2021 , before a select group of other Prime Minister and Cabinet officials was introduced to the plan .\nFormer finance minister Senator Simon Birmingham recalled having a discussion with Morrison in about March 2021 , around the time he believed when members of the cabinet \u2019 s national security committee were also informed .\nIt meant that for at least 18 months Morrison \u2019 s secret was shared with a narrow group , most of whom were khaki-clad \u2014 or wearing navy whites \u2014 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows .\n( One exception was former chief scientist Alan Finkel . )\nCommentators would later marvel at how tightly the AUKUS secret was kept .\nBut now we know that keeping plans secret is no great achievement for Scott Morrison : it is second nature to him and key to how he operates , for better or ( as is often the case ) worse .\nNext : All the prime minister \u2019 s men .", "author": "David Hardaker", "url":

for Republican Senate nominee JD Vance , former US president ( and future presidential hopeful ) Donald Trump spoke to dramatic background music while his supporters raised their hands in a straight-armed , one-fingered salute .\nComparisons were immediately drawn between it and the Nazi salute ( or , less ominously , the three-fingered salute from The Hunger Games ) but it \u2019 s still unclear what it means or why it started .\nWhat does the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories about the Trump supporters \u2019 gesture is that it \u2019 s a QAnon salute ( QAnon being the global political conspiracy that originated in the American far-right political sphere and has a strong focus on Trump ) .\nAs Will Sommer , political reporter at The Daily Beast and author of a coming book on QAnon , pointed out on Twitter , the single finger could be related to the common QAnon rallying cry : \u201c Where we go one , we go all.\n\u201d Indeed , the dramatic music playing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths , war in Ukraine and \u201c fake news \u201d is a QAnon song titled \u201c WWG1WGA \u201d \u2014 an acronym for the phrase .\nIt \u2019 s not the first time Trump has used this music .\nHe \u2019 s used it at previous rallies and has also used it as a backing track to campaign videos .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s been noted by many that compared with 2020 when the then president claimed he didn \u2019 t know much about the conspiracy theory , he is now embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even posting an image of himself wearing a Q pin .\nAnother theory is that the salute signalled \u201c America First \u201d , a popular slogan used by Trump for his Make America Great Again ( MAGA ) campaign .\nThe one finger would obviously be signifying \u201c first \u201d in this instance , or even \u201c number one \u201d .\nWhat is clear is that nobody actually knows .\nAs Ben Collins , an NBC News reporter on what he calls the \u201c dystopia beat \u201d , pointed out on Twitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , even in pro-Trump forums .\nStrange things happen in crowds and it \u2019 s highly likely the signal isn \u2019 t a point to early 20th century fascism and the Nazi \u201c Sieg Heil \u201d salute or a far-right conspiracy theory gesture but rather a spontaneous outburst of collective emotion at an event designed to elicit exactly this kind of feeling .\nHowever , as The Q Origins Project writes on Twitter , just because it didn \u2019 t begin as a QAnon gesture it won \u2019 t stop the far-right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s fairly likely you \u2019 ll see it repeated at rallies and

.\nIntroduced by independent Member for Goldstein Zoe Daniel shortly after Lachlan Murdoch announced his decision to sue Crikey for defamation , the motion was debated in the Federation Chamber this afternoon .\nBelow is an excerpt of Daniel \u2019 s speech .\n\u201c The committee recommends the establishment of a judicial inquiry , with the powers of a royal commission \u2026 It is clear that the current regulatory framework is not fit for purpose and significant changes are required.\n\u201d This is a quote from the Senate committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year with the support of Labor Senators .\nTo quote from the report again : \u201c The committee heard significant evidence that Australia \u2019 s system of media regulation is not effective\u2026 \u201d including lack of oversight for digital media .\n\u201c The committee heard extensive evidence that the complaints processes for traditional media are insufficient and slow .\nThere was clear evidence that the self-regulation model for print media through the Australian Press Council is woefully inadequate .\nEqually , the Australian Communication and Media Authority \u2019 s ( ACMA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , onerous for complainants and often inconclusive.\n\u201d This was a majority report , supported by Labor Senators , and yet , like the last government , this government refuses to face up to and tackle one of the biggest existential threats to our democracy .\nInformation is power .\nDisinformation , unfortunately even more so .\nThe contraction of media means that sources of conversations around the country are fewer and less diverse ; there is less scrutiny , especially at the local level , with consequences for the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , there are no local print outlets at all .\nIn others , there are several , but they \u2019 re all run by the same company .\nAccording to the Public Interest Journalism Initiative \u2019 s Newsroom Mapping Project , 31 LGAs [ local government areas ] have no local print or digital outlet at all .\nIn just the last few weeks , for example , ACM [ Australian Community Media ] closed the print editions of the Campbelltown Macarthur Advertiser , Camden Narellan Advertiser , Fairfield City Champion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents of much of western Sydney and its southern outskirts less well informed .\nIn the United States , a study by PEN America found that as local newspapers closed local government corruption , costs and inefficiency rose while spending and environmental checks went down .\nFrom my own observations , having reported extensively in the US , the lack of local media means that political debate is had at the national level , without reference to local community impact , cost or benefit .\nThis is highly destructive , disconnects people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the void created sends people down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and makes them vulnerable to disinformation .\nThe storming of the US Capitol in January 2021 was one example of this .\nIn Australia , changes to the Broadcasting Services Act in 2017 have accelerated the trend to concentration and closure .\nThe \u201c two out of three \u201d cross-media control rule was abolished as well as the \u201c 75 % audience reach \u201d rule .\nNow , just two owners are responsible for more than 80 % of the circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not a monopoly .\nMy intention by proposing this motion is that this be the start not the end of a process .\nIt will not come to a vote , but I appreciate those who are contributing to this important discussion .\nI will conclude with a number of steps designed to give us the media framework to enhance our democracy : \u2022 ACMA , at the very least , reformed so it has teeth with the resources to initiate its own inquiries \u2022 Equally , for the Australian Press Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received and resolved \u2022 A fit and proper person test restored to the Broadcasting Services Act \u2022 Adequate and long term support for the Australian Associated Press \u2022 Support to restore broader reporting of affairs at the local , regional and rural levels As the Senate report articulates : \u201c Public interest journalism is essential to a democracy .\nActive citizenship requires access to reliable information , and democracy can not flourish without a diversity of media

ICAC?", "content": "Regarding the unveiling of the government \u2019 s legislation for a federal anti-corruption body , and the possibility that Labor has done a deal with the Coalition to avoid Senate amendments , it \u2019 s wise to remember that Labor came late to the idea of a federal ICAC .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until early 2018 that Bill Shorten finally signed Labor up for such a body , but the Greens and crossbenchers had been calling for one for years .\nAs the torrent of scandals , abuse of power , misconduct and rorting that characterised the Morrison years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened \u2014 especially in the face of the deliberately weak , secretive model that Morrison and Christian Porter wanted , which would actually have helped the corrupt cover up their crimes .\nBut it pays to remember that the transition from opposition to government can perform an almost alchemical transformation in attitudes to transparency , integrity and accountability .\nAccording to Peter Dutton , Labor has been busy discussing a federal ICAC model with the Coalition , despite the deep antipathy toward accountability and integrity modelled by the Liberals and Nationals when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an anti-corruption body are \u201c problematic \u201d and \u201c the government concedes that point \u201d .\nThe opposition may be verballing Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus , but if true , it could represent a major watering-down of the power of a federal ICAC .\nPut simply , public hearings are crucial to the effectiveness of an anti-corruption body .\nIt is terror of the \u201c perp walk \u201d in the minds of politicians , public officials and those who have tried to suborn them that will focus officials on whether particular conduct might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public hearing .\nAnd taxpayers have an absolute right to find out what their officials \u2014 elected and otherwise \u2014 have been doing .\nThe only people who don \u2019 t think public hearings are a good idea are politicians themselves , crooks who \u2019 ve been exposed , and News Corp , which hates the NSW ICAC with a passion .\nDutton also claims \u201c we \u2019 re working constructively with the government \u201d on the \u201c breadth \u201d of the body , suggesting it will be narrower than needed .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Coalition on a federal ICAC should be ringing loud alarm bells about the prospect of a major party stitch-up .\nCertainly the crossbenchers suspect one is afoot .\nThis morning , all the House of Reps crossbenchers , including Bob Katter , David Pocock and the Greens , released a statement noting that \u201c we have been raising our detailed concerns with the government for many months now in a good faith attempt to have them addressed in a timely way \u201d .\nThey want whistleblower protections , oversight mechanisms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( including secure funding ) , and the ability to self-initiate investigations , including into \u201c grey \u201d corruption \u2014 pork-barrelling , rorting , appointments of mates and other abuses of office that might not amount to criminal conduct .\nThe statement also calls for \u201c jurisdiction over third parties who seek to improperly influence government decisions and funding \u201d .\nThe word \u201c improperly \u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence .\nArguably , anyone who pays a political donation to get access to decision-makers is \u201c improperly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great bulk of us don \u2019 t have that kind of access .\nA lobbyist who is a former MP , party powerbroker or political strategist who knows their calls will be returned and their meeting requests promptly acknowledged as \u201c improperly \u201d trying to influence decisions .\nBut these kinds of influence are legal under our current , woefully inadequate donation and lobbying laws .\nFar better to regulate the problem at the source rather than wait for an egregious case to appear before a federal body .\nLabor will argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t supported by the opposition risks charges of illegitimacy and abolition at the next change of government .\nWell and good \u2014 if the Coalition wants to go to the next election promising to abolish a federal ICAC , let them knock themselves out .\nLabor would do far better to be seen to negotiate with the teal independents and David Pocock , strengthening their case to voters at the next election to keep their seats .\nTomorrow has become a significant test for Labor : once the legislation for a federal ICAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor is serious about integrity , or has indeed been preparing a major party stitch-up .\nAre you concerned Labor is losing its enthusiasm for a strong federal ICAC now it \u2019 s in government ?\nLet us know your

looks like the real deal, but key definitions of corruption remain", "content": "While the bill for a federal anti-corruption body won \u2019 t be introduced into Parliament until tomorrow , its design principles are becoming clearer , and it seems the government is committed to an effective body .\nIn response to a question from independent Zoe Daniel yesterday , Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said the commission would be able to pursue \u201c conduct by any person that could adversely affect the honesty or impartiality of a public official \u2019 s conduct \u201d .\nAnd in response to a question from independent Allegra Spender , Dreyfus settled the matter of public hearings : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commission because the experience of the eight existing state and territory commissions has shown us that in order for an anti-corruption commission such as we proposing to be effective , there must be the possibility of public hearings.\n\u201d That \u2019 s exactly right \u2014 the effectiveness of an anti-corruption body requires public hearings .\nIn doing so , Dreyfus contradicted Opposition Leader Peter Dutton , who had claimed the government had conceded public hearings could amount to \u201c show trials \u201d , a position held only by the Coalition , News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe remaining concern about the federal body is the definition of the conduct that would fall within its jurisdiction : \u201c serious or systemic corruption \u201d .\nThe systemic part is straightforward ; \u201c serious \u201d is more complicated .\nThe NSW ICAC approach has an expansive definition of corrupt conduct that includes adversely affecting the honest or impartial exercise of official functions by any public official , dishonest or partial exercise of official functions , a breach of public trust , or the misuse of information .\nBut that definition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a criminal offence , a disciplinary offence , conduct that would be reasonable grounds for dismissing a public official , or for ministers and MPs a substantial breach of an applicable code of conduct .\nNote terms like \u201c reasonable grounds \u201d and \u201c substantial \u201d \u2014 the NSW legislation requires ICAC commissioners to exercise some judgment about what might justify an investigation .\nIt appears the Labor model will rely more heavily on commissioners \u2019 discretion to determine what \u201c serious \u201d might amount to , without limiting it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The threshold must be set somewhere ; allowing the body itself to set the limits might work better than Parliament attempting to prescribe it .\nThe benefit of that approach is that a future Coalition government will have less capacity to narrow the remit of the body by dictating what conduct should be examined .\nOne more thing : probably the most absurd argument against an effective federal ICAC came on the weekend from Liberal Senator Jane Hume .\nIt \u2019 s worth quoting her words on the ABC \u2019 s Sunday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective anti-corruption body would deter good people from entering public life is remarkable .\nIs the quality of federal MPs an indicator of the \u201c good \u201d people who have entered public life undeterred because there \u2019 s no federal ICAC ?\nLet \u2019 s have a look .\nScott Morrison , who led the most corrupt government in federal history , who secretly swore himself into ministries and told the Murdoch press but not his own ministers , who misled Parliament , whose office smeared critics and led the partisan misuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus Taylor , whose office was embroiled in a police investigation involving forged documents attacking political opponents ?\nAlan Tudge ?\nChristian Porter ?\nMichaelia Cash ?\nBridget McKenzie ?\nAnd perhaps Hume hasn \u2019 t checked Hansard lately , but the idea that the lack of a federal ICAC prevents people from making corruption charges doesn \u2019 t exactly hold up .\nIt \u2019 s only a couple of months since Dutton opened his first question time by asking if the prime minister had been consorting with rapists .\nThe lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud-throwing .\nBut once it

having been technocrats appointed by the president in deals with the European Union to continue the interminable and largely fruitless process of restructuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy and bring them within range of Germany , France and the Benelux countries .\nThe most recent government included all the major parties \u2014 except the FDI , which at that time was polling 4 % .\nAs your correspondent noted a fortnight ago , the FDI was gaining legitimacy from their anti-political stand , as all other parties became tarred with failure .\nThat has now come out spectacularly well for them , gaining right-wing votes from both the Lega ( the old Northern League ) , down from 17 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Forza Italia down from 14 % to 8 % .\nThe \u201c anti-political \u201d populist Five

from 72 % to 60 % .\nThat puts the right vote at 43 % , the left at 23 % .\nSplit the 5SM down the middle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the left barely makes it to 30 % .\nIt \u2019 s a diabolical result , and it gets worse when you look at voting by class .\nWorkers ( \u201c operai \u201d in the linked graph ) gave FDI the largest vote by group , at 35 % , and only 11 % of them voted for the PD .\nThis is essentially the same story as in the US and elsewhere \u2014 workers have decisively left the left .\nTheir active preference for FDI over the rest of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion that FDI \u2019 s vote is just shuffled-round right-wing votes .\nThe shift is real ( though also inertial \u2014 turnout was extra-low in worker and low-income groups ) .\nMeloni \u2019 s impending victory was not much commented on before the election .\nNow it has got everyone doing their best homage to Catalonia and the Spanish Civil War .\nThe fascists are at the gates !\nThey \u2019 re in the city !\nAre they ?\nWell , yes\u2026 but also no .\nThe desire to simply label Meloni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics as fascist is a desire to have a clear-cut enemy , and revive scattered and defeated liberal and progressive confidence .\nBut really it reveals a need for us to reexamine the history of the 20th century , the ready-made categories it has handed us , and the need to rethink them in a way that is pretty much tap-dancing through a minefield .\nMeloni \u2019 s FDI is a successor to the Italian Social Movement ( MSI ) , the party founded by fascists and others after World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of arbitrary state violence as an expression of historical will , and retained its base , the notion of organic corporatism \u2014 the anti-liberal idea that a society is a mix of defined groups , hitherto unified by tradition , now , in modernity , by state action .\nLiberalism , in the corporatist account , leads to meaningless and anomie .\nOnly through group membership , and that group \u2019 s membership of the nation , does the individual \u2019 s life have meaning .\nMany of the actual fascists went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would erupt in \u201c black hand \u201d political violence in the 1970s , probably aided by elements of the Italian state as part of a \u201c strategy of tension \u201d ( their worst atrocities \u2014 such as the 1980 Bologna railway station bombing \u2014 are now often falsely remembered as Red Brigade acts ) .\nThe MSI leadership was precise , rational , democratic , led by the efficient Gianfranco Fini , and its membership was nuttier than an almond panettone , stuffed full of occultists and reactionaries .\nThey followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionalist \u201d Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non who believed modernity would eventually come to a crisis .\nUntil then , Evola counselled , \u201c ride the tiger \u201d and be ready to take power when the tiger , er , comes apart .\nGu\u00e9non \u2019 s anti-modern philosophy in 1945 \u2019 s The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times was highly influential \u2014 and highly anti-Semitic .\nYou can see this stuff bubbling up in Meloni \u2019 s talk , captured on YouTube , about consumerism , slaves and the mastery of global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c anti-capitalism of fools \u201d , I guess , drawing on shadowy notions of conspiracy to explain a global process .\nBut it \u2019 s a global process that has had its champions and agents , and in a stagnant country like Italy , which EU trans-nationalism has helped make a backwater , it has a great deal of appeal now that every other explanation or approach has been exhausted .\nSo if Meloni \u2019 s party suspends democracy , throws thousands in prison and sends out death squads , one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , it is best seen as a form of neo-reaction , which has had strong appeal on a range of economic , cultural and political grounds .\nBut here \u2019 s the real difficulty .\nThe generalisation of the notion of \u201c fascism \u201d has been a barrier to our thinking about its continuities , and its place in the political spectrum .\nMussolini \u2019 s fascism was seen , at the time , as simply a violent but acceptable answer to the problems of organising post-imperial Europe .\nBeneath its violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fast-forward the national integration that the UK and France had achieved with capitalism and a resultant state .\nPeople of right and left queued up to praise Mussolini as he got the country working , built new cities ( and good God , I \u2019 m sorry , but his train stations are fantastic ) , drained malarial swamps , etc .\nThat history is altered in memory because in 1938 he conformed fascism to Hitler \u2019 s Nazism , a movement genuinely outside the left-right political dialogue .\nAnti-Semitic laws were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been full of Jews , and whose navy trained hundreds of \u201c revisionist Zionist \u201d armed squads in the organisation that is the precursor of Likud .\nWhen Mussolini allied with Hitler in WWII , it was done .\nNazism , with its genocidal exterminism , became what fascism was .\nThis is not to soften the notion of what Italian fascism was , but to point out how much of it survives elsewhere .\nFirstly , there were more violent things than fascism , and the historical memory is used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the left used that to avoid facing the violence of Stalinism and Leninist Bolshevism .\nNow the liberal right uses it to obscure what everyone understood at the time : that the empires of Britain , France and other European powers enacted violence and racism on a world scale , under the cover of parliamentary democracy at home , such as to make Italian fascism look like a piker .\nViolent repression in Algeria , the Bengal famine of 1943 , the partition of India-Pakistan , the concentration camps of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mussolini \u2019 s fascism did ( save for its own imperial adventures in Africa ) until joining the Axis powers .\nBut until the past decade or so , this was all obscured under the memory of World War II and the identification of fascism with the Axis powers .\nBut if you wonder why , in the 1930s , people were unable to get as morally exercised about fascism \u2014 even when they went to fight it \u2014 as we do now , it \u2019 s because they were in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many .\nWhat about now ?\nWell , using the term \u201c fascism \u201d for mere state authoritarianism calls up the \u2019 60s/ \u2019 70s style of Marcuse and Deleuze/Guattari , for whom democracy itself is fascism , and so too , eventually , is the happy family , stable subjectivity , etc .\nBut at the same time , there are elements in modern societies which need to be named as on the edge of fascistic , in their use of aestheticised violence and state power , combined with corporatism .\nIsrael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , the revisionist-fascist heritage coming out in its long occupation , its Jewish-state loyalty oaths , the meted-out cruelty of its apartheid internal pass system , the protected vigilantism of settlers , the steady demolition of Palestinian neighbourhoods under spurious ownership laws , and the stylishness of the IDF in their cool black uniforms as , for the world \u2019 s cameras , they beat the shit out of Arab kids in rags .\nBut look also at something like the Western Australian McGowan government .\nWhile the Andrews government can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the McGowan government \u2014 with its Black kids in adult prisons , its new and distinctive indefinite detention laws aimed at defendants with a series of minor convictions in crimes that have a high Black perpetrator rate \u2014 is genuinely on the outer edge of fascistic , and one needs the word to be applicable to such , in order to make clear the horrors of what is going on .\nDitto with the carceral regimes of the US .\nBeyond that , you have to look at where the violence really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal the toll of death and misery of decades of the global neoliberal \u201c Washington consensus \u201d in its various forms , still continuing today .\nYes , not the radical evil of Nazism or Stalinism , just the quiet everyday destruction of the possibility of healthcare , education and development decade upon decade in vast areas of the global South .\nWhich brings us to an interesting point in the hail of horror directed at Meloni and her victory .\nThe new argument seems to be that because she is both noxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any discussion of global consumerism and financialisation is anti-Semitic , that any notion of borders and the social centrality of the family is fascist .\nThis is not anti-fascism .\nThis is the progressivism of elite sections of the knowledge class making its peace with neoliberalism and going into an alliance , against all those who want an anti-globalism the left has been unwilling to provide .\nThat will end in predictable and obvious disaster .\nShouting \u201c fascism \u201d at everything people want to protect , will simply , eventually have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I \u2019 m a fascist \u2014 so what ?\n\u201d It will thus restore the broken continuity with fascism as it was , and the movement will become mass again .\nFascinating fascism , the eternal return of the repressed , a new violent history , blonde but with the brown

came a welcome to country ceremony , followed by an acoustic performance of \u201c We Are Australian \u201d .\nCountry Liberal Party Senator and rising star Jacinta Price then gave the opening address .\n\u201c First , I \u2019 d like to pay my respects to\u2026 \u201d she began , pausing for effect , \u201c \u2026every proud Australian !\n\u201d After being on hiatus for COVID-19 , CPAC Australia came at a crucial time for conservative politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shellacked at the last election after nearly a decade in power , and now just two states are led by right-wing premiers \u2014 both of whom have led moderate governments .\nI was among 1000 attendees who made their way to the ICC in Sydney to hear from a mix of Australian right-wing politicians and commentators and a few headline international names like Nigel Farage , former Trump adviser Jason Miller , and former Trump acting attorney-general Matt Whitaker .\nWhat the audience heard over the weekend , the speakers promised , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservative political movement .\nSpeakers listed their many enemies \u2014 most common were climate scientists , indoctrinating teachers , unelected bureaucrats , Dictator Dan , and the radical and woke left \u2014 but one group earned more opprobrium from the crowd than almost any other : \u201c conservative cowards \u201d , said Farage .\nI saw some attendees and speakers clearly thought some of them were inside the room .\nThrough the weekend , a sense of conflict and contradiction bubbled barely below the surface , only to erupt towards the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday morning , I noticed a heavy police presence around the ICC \u2019 s entrances .\nThe centre \u2019 s staff \u2014 masked \u2014 checked my ticket at the doors before I went up to the CPAC registration where my ticket was checked again .\nThey gave me a tote bag , which included a copy of the far-right conspiracy-promoting newspaper The Epoch Times , The Spectator and a flyer advertising Institute of Public Affairs ( IPA ) memberships for \u201c only \u201d $ 99 .\nI was running a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the conference lobby was mostly empty , barring a cardboard cut-out of Donald Trump .\nI hurried into the back of the full auditorium as the welcome to country was happening .\nThe front section was roped off for golden-ticket holders ( \u201c only $ 479 for members \u201d ) .\nI was in the back with everyone else .\nThe audience appeared to be , for the most part , older , white and fully engrossed in Price \u2019 s speech .\nThe Voice to Parliament was the major target of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was dedicated to the case against it .\nPrice promised that constitutionally enshrining an Indigenous advisory body would create \u201c racial separatism \u201d .\nFormer prime minister Tony Abbott said a Voice wasn \u2019 t necessary because of existing Indigenous federal politicians and would be \u201c discrimination \u201d .\nEven international speakers weighed in .\nWhitaker warned against altering Australia \u2019 s constitution , citing America \u2019 s near-religious obsession with its own founding document .\nThe rest of the conference \u2019 s Australian speakers focused on the other ideological battlegrounds .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrera declared students were being \u201c indoctrinated \u201d by a national curriculum including criticism of Australia \u2019 s colonial history as well as sex and gender education .\nProfessor Ian Plimer ( falsely ) claimed that no one had ever proven that humankind \u2019 s carbon emissions have contributed to climate change .\nOne Nation \u2019 s Mark Latham declared that long COVID wasn \u2019 t a disease \u2014 despite huge amounts of research showing its biological impact \u2014 but a \u201c mental state \u201d caused by watching the mainstream media .\nReferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes of Bruce Pascoe \u2019 s Dark Emu , Labor \u2019 s promise of a $ 275 power bill reduction , and eating bugs all landed with the audience without much explanation .\nSimilarly , the audience seemed to get references to US politics , including boos for Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and even Republican Liz Cheney .\nDuring the breaks , we filtered back into the lobby .\nAttendees who \u2019 d bought general tickets stood around in the mostly empty room while the golden-ticket holders went to the \u201c golden-ticket room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refreshments .\nThere were huge queues for the general bathrooms , but I was able to skip the line by using a gender-neutral toilet ignored by everyone else .\nI spoke to some other attendees over the weekend .\nSheree told me she didn \u2019 t like some of the more \u201c extreme \u201d parts of the conference but was worried about gender and environmental policies .\nDuncan told me he flew from Tasmania to see Zuby , a speaker billed as a \u201c popular rapper \u201d who gave a TED Talk-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that went viral .\nAfter Zuby \u2019 s session , I overheard an elderly man say : \u201c I was expecting him to do a rap dance.\n\u201d A major theme of the weekend was how conservatives were demonised for their views .\nMany of the speakers talked about how they would be criticised or attacked for what they said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s obvious from looking at us that CPAC is a racist organisation , \u201d joked its Australia chairman and Indigenous man Warren Mundine during a panel of Indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us anti-Semitic \u2026 or white nationalists , \u201d said CPAC USA chairman and former White House political director Matt Schlapp when talking about other CPAC conferences in Israel and Japan .\nMuch of the conference was defined by jabs at their political opposition .\nMultiple speakers mocked the idea of acknowledgments of country and using gender pronouns .\nThere was not a hint of irony as Schlapp , shortly before talking about the different CPAC conferences around the world , spoke about his fear of the left \u2019 s \u201c well-funded global movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their perceived run-ins with censorship and cancel culture .\nAbbott shared a story about how he was invited to officially open facilities at a primary school when he was prime minister .\nHe was invited to tour the school afterwards and made his way into a Year 6 classroom where they were learning about how pollution caused climate change .\nWhen Abbott began to interrogate the 11- and 12-year-olds about whether they knew about the Ice Age and natural fluctuations in the world \u2019 s climate , he was , by his telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher .\nLater in the conference , Ukrainian think tank director Nataliya Melnyk spoke about her country \u2019 s battle for survival against Russia and the death of some of her friends in the war .\n( Almost simultaneously , Schlapp had to apologise for CPAC tweeting a message that criticised the US for \u201c gift-giving to Ukraine \u201d , featured a Russian flag , and used Putin-esque rhetoric by calling it \u201c Ukraine occupied territories \u201d . )\nEven as the conference attempted to present a buttoned-up , polished image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPAC flirted with the fringe .\nTopher Field , director of the anti-lockdown documentary Battleground Melbourne , led a multimedia session featuring three Victorians who spoke about how Daniel Andrews \u2019 COVID-19 restrictions had hurt them .\nThe carefully choreographed performance \u2014 complete with lighting cues and dramatic orchestral background music \u2014 omitted the histories of their speakers .\nOne speaker , Matt Lawson , is an anti-5G conspiracy theorist who hand-delivered pamphlets with vaccine misinformation to aged care facilities during the 2021 lockdown .\nAnother , Carly Soderstrom , spoke about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos blaming lockdowns for pushing her into bankruptcy .\nShe reportedly lied about using GoFundMe proceeds raised for COVID-19 relief to pay back debts accrued before the pandemic .\nThe session also featured footage and reference to Monica Smit , the founder of Australia \u2019 s biggest anti-vaccine group Reignite Democracy Australia .\nThe session was given a standing ovation .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until one of the last sessions of CPAC that Peter Dutton was mentioned .\n\u201c Where is Peter Dutton ?\n\u201d asked One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queensland senator took aim at the conservative party leader \u2019 s absence , the Coalition and the conference itself , which he derisively called \u201c LPAC \u201d ( the \u201c L \u201d standing for Liberal Party ) .\nIt was enough to light a fire in the crowd .\nThe subsequent session , titled \u201c The Road Back of the Coalition \u201d , kicked off with boos after former senator Amanda Stoker , one of the panellists , said : \u201c Wouldn \u2019 t it be good if we spent a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not our own side ?\n\u201d This soon grew into a full shouting match between the audience and former Liberal federal MP Nick Minchin .\nPeople in the audience began heckling when Minchin said : \u201c I don \u2019 t know that the Liberal Party needs a whole lot of changing , \u201d telling him that the party had sold out .\nIn response , Minchin said they were \u201c worse than a socialist audience \u201d and accused one man , who began walking towards the stage while shouting , of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrier reaction from the audience .\nThe host was eventually able to soothe the audience by guiding the conversation back to common ground : opposing lockdowns .\nThroughout the weekend , speakers like Farage declared the need to elect strong , conservative leaders and criticised the Coalition for failing to do so .\nLiberal leaders like Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison were unpopular with both speakers and the audience .\nI didn \u2019 t attend the Saturday night gala , but footage shared online afterwards by Craig Kelly showed that NSW Liberal Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he received the angriest reaction from the audience when mentioned during the conference .\nEven Liberal Party politicians who were or would have been celebrated by the party \u2019 s base just a few years ago were received coolly by the audience .\nA recorded address from former prime minister John Howard , which made the case for the Liberal Party \u2019 s embrace of both conservatism and liberalism , received a tepid response .\nThe audience was significantly less interested in Stoker \u2014 who was selected to speak at multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future prime minister \u201d by Liberal Party vice-president Teena McQueen \u2014 than it was in Latham or Roberts .\nThe feeling is mutual , at least for some .\nOn the first day , near a protest against the conference , an attendee wearing a \u201c Conspiracy Dundee \u201d costume and another holding a \u201c Make Australia Great Again \u201d flag posed for photos .\n\u201c Say \u2018 feral \u2019 , \u201d the costumed man said .\nNearby , I overheard a person wearing a CPAC gold-ticket lanyard saying : \u201c Unfortunately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last major speaker , Alan Jones , was met with rapturous applause .\nI left the speech as the broadcaster began to lash Liberal governments for profligate spending to do a television interview about the conference .\nSomeone from CPAC came over to speak to the camera crew while they were setting up with an offer of a \u201c spicy \u201d interview with Roberts or another speaker .\nWhen the camera operators looked at each other and shook their heads , the man \u2019 s face fell and he strode off .", "author": "Cam Wilson", "url": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/10/04/cpac-australia-conservatives-nigel-farage-jacinta-price/", "published":

consistency on political integrity \u2014 it\u2019s not only Libs or Nats who get tempted to lie", "content": "So there are three debates about the stage three tax cuts , or three tangled parts of one debate among the politically engaged , which is maybe 2 % of the population .\nFirst is about policy : are the tax cuts an effective use of the maybe $ 150-200 billion they will cost over a decade ( not $ 240 billion ) ?\nThe answer to that is likely no , except if you work at the Financial Review .\nThe tax cuts are the product of the pre-pandemic era when the return to a balanced budget was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better uses of such a sum regardless .\nThey will also deepen inequality .\nOn the other hand , we rely too much on personal income tax ; beneficiaries of the tax cuts on incomes like $ 180,000 are doing well but are by no means \u201c rich \u201d if they \u2019 re living in a major city with a million-dollar mortgage .\nSecond is the debate about the politics : can the new government get away with breaking its promise to keep the tax cuts as legislated ?\nMany , primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the electorate will accept that times have changed and the tax cuts are no longer affordable ; others say that Albanese and Chalmers should make a virtue of doing the right thing fiscally and economically , even if hurts politically \u2014 ultimately that will redound to their advantage .\nThose primarily on the right and in the media mutter about Gillard \u2019 s carbon tax promise ( which , actually , she didn \u2019 t break , but anyway ) , Keating \u2019 s L-A-W tax cuts , and Tony Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will hand a huge weapon to the Coalition and undermine , perhaps fatally , perceptions of Anthony Albanese as trustworthy .\nThe third is the one that far fewer are happy to engage in : what does it mean for political integrity if the government breaks its promise ?\nIf Albanese and Chalmers \u2014 say , in the May 2023 budget \u2014 dump stage three or even amend it significantly , it \u2019 s a major broken promise .\nLabor promised to honour the tax cuts , over and over , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t like them .\nIt would mean Labor misled voters .\nPerhaps it would be a lie : Labor always planned to ditch the tax cuts , but decided simply to pretend ahead of the election to support them .\nOr perhaps it would be a falsehood \u2014 Labor at the time intended to retain the tax cuts , but had since decided to dump them .\nBut if it \u2019 s good enough to call out Scott Morrison for lies and falsehoods , which we did scores of times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same to Albanese .\nLabor supporters , opponents of the tax cuts and most on the left , including most people reading this , will object : but this is different .\nThis is a promise that should be broken .\nCircumstances have changed .\nThis is a good government governing in the public interest , not a rotten government like Morrison \u2019 s .\nWhat that all boils down to is : my side shouldn \u2019 t be subjected to the same standard as the other side .\nWe \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break a promise , it \u2019 s for a good reason .\nOf course , that \u2019 s what your political or ideological opponents think , too .\nFor them a broken promise or a falsehood is every bit as justified by the public interest , or by the need to keep those awful socialists out of power .\nIn my book Lies and Falsehoods I wrote about the phenomenon of \u201c blue lies \u201d , a US term for police lying in court to protect their colleagues , or to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets convicted .\nPolitical debate is riddled with blue lies , and it \u2019 s becoming worse .\nLies that people think are justified by the circumstances .\nLies that lead to a good outcome .\nLies that are needed .\nWhat the left , and opponents of the tax cuts , are engaging in is blue lying , same as the right did ad nauseam when Morrison was PM .\nYou either apply the same standards in public life to everyone , or you don \u2019 t .\nFew of those making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ditching the tax cuts is justified \u2014 would have ever cut Morrison such slack .\nBut Morrison was awful , they \u2019 ll reply .\nThis is different .\nMaybe it \u2019 s different , but that doesn \u2019 t change the fact that ditching tax cuts would be a broken promise .\nThere are ways for the government to avoid breaking the promise .\nIt can increase other taxes .\nIt could introduce a high income earners \u2019 deficit levy ( including on large corporations ) .\nMaybe it could shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very wealthiest receive from them \u2014 though that wouldn \u2019 t do much for the budget .\nA small amendment to the tax cuts wouldn \u2019 t be a broken promise , just a bit of casuistry .\nNot enough to make it onto a putative list of Albanese Lies and Falsehoods .\nBut ditching them is a broken promise .\nIt \u2019 s a lie or a falsehood .\nDoubtless plenty of readers strongly disagree and will berate me in the comments .\nBut either you \u2019 re consistent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re cheerleading .\nTake your pick .\nDo you think the government should ditch the stage three tax cuts ?\nOr would you consider it a broken promise worthy of Scott Morrison ?\nLet us know your thoughts by writing to letters @ crikey.com.au .\nPlease include your full name to be considered for

attract more headlines , the immediate legal threat to the disgraced former president stems from his theft of classified documents and his attempts to obstruct efforts to return them .\nOvernight , the committee investigating the January 6 insurrection voted unanimously to subpoena Trump .\n\u201c He must be accountable , \u201d Bennie G Thompson , the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the committee , said .\nThe committee also released an array of material further implicating Trump in the incitement of the insurrection .\nNew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicted previous testimony both from Secret Service officials and former Trump staff that the violent nature of the protests on January 6 took them by surprise .\nInstead , it \u2019 s now clear the Secret Service was aware that attendees planned to bring weapons , and was directly warned of the violent \u2014 and perhaps even lethal \u2014 intentions of Trump supporters .\nThe committee also produced new corroboration of previous evidence that Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was told by Trump in response to McCarthy \u2019 s request that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Kevin , I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\n\u201d McCarthy has never confirmed the conversation , but multiple sources have now said McCarthy told them of the exchange .\nThe committee released testimony that showed Trump was aware he \u2019 d lost the election : former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson , who provided some of the most damning evidence against Trump , revealed that Trump , after the US Supreme Court refused to hear attempts to overturn the election , told his chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t want people to know we lost.\n\u201d The committee also revealed a plan by right-wing supporters of Trump to declare victory before the results were known on the night of the election , including by claiming a fictional \u201c election day deadline \u201d \u2014 to such an extent that aides to then vice president Pence tried to work out ways to avoid Pence being forced to offer an opinion .\nBut while the subpoena is big news , the committee is running out of time before the mid-term elections on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still tipped to deliver control of the House to Republicans .\nMcCarthy has already indicated he will kill the committee off if he becomes majority leader .\nOne view is that the subpoena , which Trump will refuse to comply with , is a pro forma effort by the committee to say it offered Trump a chance to testify before issuing its final report .\nThe committee also released footage taken during the insurrection as House and Senate leaders on both sides frantically call a variety of officials , governors and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing the Capitol .\nTrump \u2019 s far more immediate concern is prosecution over his theft of classified documents and his efforts to prevent their return after repeated demands that he surrender them .\nYesterday , The Washington Post reported that one of Trump \u2019 s aides at his Mar-a-Lago estate has dramatically altered their evidence after being interviewed by the FBI , and admitted Trump ordered boxes of classified documents to be moved to his residence following a subpoena for them .\nSecurity camera footage confirms boxes of documents being moved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a further attempt to prevent the return of the documents , which Trump had no authority to remove from the White House after his presidency ended .\nTrump \u2019 s legal efforts to derail possible prosecution over stealing classified documents also took a hit when the Supreme Court flatly rejected an effort by Trump to overturn a court order preventing the documents seized from his property being vetted by a judicial officer .\nThe decision means the Department of Justice can continue to compile its case against Trump unimpeded by interference by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump is prosecuted on the most open-and-shut case of his criminality , his theft of documents , it will make for a rich irony .\nTrump , along with many Republicans , made much of fictitious claims of Hillary Clinton as secretary

circus, while NSW Labor prepares for power", "content": "On current polling , Victorian Premier Dan Andrews looks set for an even bigger win on November 26 than his monster 2018 victory .\nThe most recent Morgan poll has Victorian Labor leading the Coalition by 20 points in two-party-preferred ( 2PP ) terms , though that poll also shows a substantially higher independents vote .\nBut if a 60-40 outcome actually happens , the large number of very marginal Victorian Coalition seats could see the opposition lose 10 .\nThat would leave the Coalition with around a dozen seats , and maybe a bigger crossbench than opposition .\nSuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crikey readers hate it when I criticise Dan Andrews , but the Victorian Liberals are much worse \u2014 wholly lacking in competence , integrity or even basic political smarts , a party that abandoned its moderate history in favour of embracing religious fundamentalists and flirting with the conspiracy theorist far right .\nEven now some of its candidates are calling Andrews a murderer and urging he be \u201c brought to justice \u201d .\nWhat next \u2014 \u201c lock him up \u201d chants ?\nIt \u2019 s a different picture in NSW , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a credible alternative to the Coalition and now looks odds-on to win next March .\nAlthough , as in Victoria , the performance of independents is a major question , and one that could determine if Labor governs in its own right .\nThe states are at different points in their political cycles \u2014 Andrews \u2019 is a two-term government , while Dominic Perrottet is seeking a fourth term for the Coalition .\nBut NSW Labor was competitive at the 2019 election and picked up seats , while the NSW Nationals lost seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would eventually become a minority Coalition government .\nIn Victoria , the Liberals aren \u2019 t unelectable after two terms , and it \u2019 s not clear what their path back to credibility is in a third unless Andrews and his successor implode spectacularly .\nWhat makes the failure of the Victorian Liberals far worse is that they started in opposition in relatively good shape \u2014 Denis Napthine \u2019 s 2014 loss was hardly a landslide .\nNSW Labor , in contrast , was obliterated in the 2011 election , reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate for a party that had become synonymous with corruption and dysfunction .\nThe other big contrast is in talent \u2014 Labor under Minns has a solid frontbench , with a strong opposition treasurer in Daniel Mookhey , veteran Penny Sharpe in the Legislative Council , and former leader Michael Daley as opposition attorney-general .\nThe Victorian Liberals \u2014 well , where to start ?\nLiterally ?\nDespite numerous scandals during its time in opposition , NSW Labor \u2019 s formal structures have been retained and continued to function .\nThe kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberals and inflicted so much damage ahead of the federal election has been kept to a minimum .\nThe Victorian Liberals \u2019 internal structures , in contrast , have proven dysfunctional : entryism by Christian fundamentalists has been rife , along with branch-stacking , angry disputes with one of the party \u2019 s fundraising arms , and staffing scandals .\nAnd unlike in NSW , where Labor has proven highly effective at holding the government accountable , the Victorian opposition , handed scandal after scandal by the Andrews government , has proven hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about branch-stacking and the misconduct at Crown \u2014 has been the only effective opposition to Andrews .\nThe result is that the current government \u2014 one that should have been placed under huge pressure over its handling of the pandemic , the misuse of public funds by ministers and employment of taxpayer-funded electorate staff on political matters , and its overly close relationship with a major gambling company \u2014 is likely to increase an already massive majority .\nLike governments , oppositions have core functions .\nThey get the hard , unglamorous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office to scrutiny .\nAnd the Victorian Liberals have comprehensively failed to do that , and in doing so have let down Victorians .\nAs the Andrews government ages in its third term and , like all ageing governments , grows more arrogant and complacent ( see the John Barilaro scandal in NSW for a classic case ) , who \u2019 ll hold it to account ?\nNot the smoking ruins of a once-successful political party .", "author": "Bernard Keane", "url":

but the minister is in the clouds", "content": "As the Bureau of Meteorology \u201c rebrand that wasn \u2019 t \u201d descends into farce , there seems to be one important missing player .\nMost people probably didn \u2019 t even know that Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek held the meteorology portfolio , and her public response so far has thrown very little light on the issue .\nOf the ordeal , she said : \u201c I have asked for the information about the full cost of the whole rebrand project.\n\u201d And in a classic political deflection , added that \u201c the rebrand commenced under the previous government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nWhich was an unfortunate statement for a minister whose job it is to understand .\nAnd if she doesn \u2019 t understand , to find out .\nMeantime , despite the minister \u2019 s clear description , the Bureau itself then began to insist it wasn \u2019 t a rebrand at all .\nSpeaking to 2GB , an unnamed spokesperson declared \u201c the Bureau has not rebranded \u201d , instead calling it \u201c part of the Bureau \u2019 s brand refresh \u201d .\nAnd despite the Bureau \u2019 s own media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spokesperson added : \u201c The community is welcome to refer to the Bureau in any way they wish , including referring to us as the \u2018 BoM \u2019 .\nIt is up to individual media outlets to determine their style guidelines.\n\u201d Of course , the backflip was hardly a surprise , coming just one day after the minister opined that \u201c Australians should be free to call it whatever they like \u201d .\nIn reality , a backflip was probably the only realistic option in view of the appalling timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of leaving it to some anonymous spokesperson to explain , the Bureau itself should have owned the situation , formally conceding that the timing had been a mistake and the rebranding would be suspended to be revisited at a later date .\nThat would have been PR 101 .\nIn fact , this was probably the most ill-timed announcement since Qantas \u2018 notorious PR fail in October 2011 when it launched a competition asking people to describe their \u201c dream luxury in-flight experience \u201d and possibly win a pair of first-class pyjamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one day after the airline grounded its entire fleet over an industrial dispute , stranding thousands of angry passengers .\nAt least on that occasion \u2014 after predictable public outcry and hundreds of unhelpful online responses \u2014 Qantas owned the mistake and put on a brave face , taking to Twitter again to quip , \u201c at this rate our # QantasLuxury competition is going to take years to judge \u201d .\nHowever , setting aside the Bureau \u2019 s terrible timing \u2014 and whether it \u2019 s a rebrand or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been its cost \u2014 what did the minister know and what is she doing about it ?\nMoreover , that question is now becoming increasingly important in light of revelations about an allegedly long-standing toxic culture within the Bureau .\nAccording to The Saturday Paper , which reported at length on alleged mismanagement at the Bureau , neither Plibersek nor her office was aware it was about to launch the controversial new look in the middle of a flood crisis .\nWhen she demanded an urgent briefing , the response from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c unsatisfactory \u201d .\nBut BoM staff were reportedly told that they were to move full steam ahead and that the minister \u2019 s office was happy .\nNeither the rebranding nor long-standing staff unrest at the Bureau was new or unexpected .\nThe rebrand idea began well before a consultant was brought on board in September 2021 .\nThe issues of debilitating staff turnover and investigations into toxic work culture were underway long before that .\nTo be fair , while Plibersek is a very experienced cabinet minister , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was sworn in as recently as June 1 2022 .\nSo it may be that the Bureau was not seen as a high priority .\nIt may even be true that the minister and her office were not aware of the disastrous timing of the Bureau \u2019 s rebrand announcement .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean they didn \u2019 t know , or shouldn \u2019 t have known , that the potentially risky exercise was underway .\nAs an incoming minister she would have received a portfolio briefing from the Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upcoming issues .\nWe can also assume that over the past five months she has received regular update briefings .\nThe minister initially said she had asked about the cost of the rebrand , though cost is perhaps the least important aspect .\nYesterday it was reported that Plibersek said she has \u201c now received a brief on a range of issues at the BoM \u2014 including cultural issues \u201d and would be \u201c considering that carefully \u201d .\nHowever , the real questions remain .\nWhat was the minister told about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When was she told , and what questions did she ask of her officials ?\nAnd if she wasn \u2019 t told , why not , and who made that decision ?\nEven more importantly , what does the minister plan to do about the obvious dysfunction in her department ?\nIn the absence of any explanation so far by the minister , these are the questions that need to be asked \u2014 and soon \u2014 in Parliament or at Senate

structural problems that have locked so many Australians out of owning a home and , increasingly , renting one .\nYesterday \u2019 s budget contains multiple housing initiatives \u2014 some the implementation of election commitments , others , like the National Housing Accord , entirely new .\nThey \u2019 re all in the service of an \u201c aspirational target of 1 million new , well-located

keep up with projected demand , and maybe not enough if we let immigration rip again like the government proposes to do and business desperately wants .\nMore concrete is the actual commitment to a Housing Australia Future Fund that will build 30,000 \u2014 not 1 million \u2014 social and affordable homes over five years .\nThat \u2019 s along with another 10,000 affordable homes under the Housing Accord , plus another 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 an important commitment given the history of state governments , especially state Labor governments , throttling back social housing spending when the Commonwealth steps up .\nState , territory and local governments have also agreed to \u201c expedite zoning , planning and land release to deliver on a joint commitment to improve the availability of social and affordable housing in well-located areas , including looking for immediate opportunities to free up well-located state land \u201d .\nThat \u2019 s been promised many times before , without apparent success .\nWith cities like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwart medium-density housing , affordable dwellings in well-located areas look something of a pipedream .\nWisely , the government is in effect restoring the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council , a body similar to the advisory body abolished by the Abbott government because it was too prone to arriving at independent conclusions ( like negative gearing being one of the biggest impediments to good housing policy in the country ) .\nIt \u2019 s also establishing a bespoke policy home for housing , ending the problem of housing \u2014 which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 being fragmented across the bureaucracy .\nAll good things , and a huge change from the Coalition , which treats housing policy as a challenge to see how best it can funnel the money of low-income and young people to its baby boomer membership .\nThe accord also talks vaguely about tapping into superannuation funds for funding home construction .\nBut that can only happen if governments guarantee strong returns , either via guaranteed funding streams to cover the gap between affordable and market rents , or guaranteeing loans \u2014 or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds are open to the criticism of not pursuing their members \u2019 best financial interests .\nThese deals will generate complex financial engineering \u2014 with ticket clippers and advisers profiting off that complexity \u2014 that essentially covers the fact that governments are subsidising the private sector to do what the government itself could be doing more cheaply : borrowing money at triple-A rated interest rates and building housing itself .\nIt also amounts to a truly massive intervention in the construction industry , which is still struggling with the consequences of the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rare government beast \u2014 especially rare under Scott Morrison \u2014 of a policy that worked too well , pumping so much stimulus into construction , which was facing a massive crisis in late 2020 , that already parlous industry conditions like supply problems and labour shortages were significantly worsened .\nThat helped drive up costs and delays , leading to state governments slowing their civil engineering infrastructure investment .\nNo wonder the Property Council and the Master Builders Association loved the Housing Accord .\nIt \u2019 s like HomeBuilder but over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2029 , with tens of thousands of extra homes being built directly by governments , state governments looking for land supply to unlock , and super funds hunting for guaranteed return investments .\nWhere will the workers come from ?\nImmigration , most likely \u2014 the budget assumes migration of 235,000 people a year over the forward estimates .\nOf course , higher immigration means we need more housing , but let \u2019 s not go there .\nIf the budget is to be believed , there \u2019 s a housing boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be big .",

supply bill was roundly criticised in Parliament , even uniting the opposition and government , in what one academic says highlights the party \u2019 s newfound hubris after the election results .\nGriffith MP Max Chandler-Mather told Crikey on Wednesday he had no regrets and that the government was feigning \u201c faux outrage \u201d to distract from a set of controversial tax cuts .\nThe night before , a full hour after the treasurer \u2019 s budget speech when most of the chamber had emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motions of passing appropriations and supply bills , Chandler-Mather moved to amend a set of bills in order to make a protest speech about the government \u2019 s stage three tax cuts .\n\u201c The perversity of it is that we all sat here , hearing the treasurer talk about a sensible budget with tough choices , but everyone in this place is going to get an extra $ 9000 a year once the stage three tax cuts come into effect , \u201d Chandler-Mather said .\n\u201c What are the tough choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWhat are the tough choices that the billionaires and millionaires are making , who are going to get the $ 9000 extra a year out of the stage three tax cuts ?\n\u201d

hypocrisy of a government that claims to care about ordinary people but gives $ 9000 extra a year to the politicians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The move made Leader of the House Tony Burke see red .\n\u201c There are different times in this place where either side of politics or the crossbench will do something that \u2019 s ostensibly viewed as a bit of a stunt to highlight an issue , and I respect that , but I \u2019 ve never seen one like this , \u201d he said .\nBurke said if the amendment were to be carried , it would \u201c negate the bill \u201d because there wouldn \u2019 t be enough time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before late November .\n\u201c That puts in jeopardy the wages of every public servant \u2014 including , I might add , the public servants delivering the exact sorts of payments that the member might want to refer to .\n\u201c In terms of stunts there are plenty of bills where you can move a second reading amendment , but to pick supply \u2026 I thought the sorts of arguments as to whether supply would be jeopardised in Australia were dispensed quite some decades ago.\n\u201d LNP MP Stuart Robert rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed without amendment \u201c in line with Westminster convention \u201d .\n\u201c It is normally an extraordinary thing when the opposition will stand in solidarity with the government , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It is a rare thing when it comes to stunts in this place .\nThe leader of the house and I have been doing this for a long time \u2026 but neither of us can remember a time when a rookie error like this was made.\n\u201d The amendment was voted down .\nChandler-Mather told Crikey he never meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Greens made clear that we wouldn \u2019 t block supply and there was no chance of that happening , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The amendment literally read \u2018 whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading \u2019 , while under House rules private members can \u2019 t move amendments that could block supply .\n\u201c After all Burke \u2019 s bluster , the supply bill passed completely uneventfully , so I imagine all the faux outrage was to distract from the stage three tax cuts that will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ordinary people suffer 56 % increases in energy bills and stagnant wages .\n\u201c The Greens will take every opportunity we can to highlight how disgraceful it is that in a cost-of-living crisis , the government wants to spend $ 254 billion on the stage three tax cuts , rather than bring dental into Medicare or invest in public housing.\n\u201d Monash University politics lecturer Blair Williams said the move showed that the Greens feel emboldened after their election success in May , boosting their numbers in Parliament to four MPs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they feel like they \u2019 re representing the young vote and the over a third of Australians who are renting , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Young people \u2019 s interests aren \u2019 t being represented

Alliance , is running misleading ads about transgender people in a campaign against a proposed equality bill for New South Wales .\nThe bill , announced in March 2022 by independent member for Sydney

the parent says next \u201c could be illegal in NSW \u201d , comparing NSW \u2019 s proposed equality bill to Victoria \u2019 s Change or Suppression ( Conversion ) Practices Prohibition Act 2021 , which outlawed conversion therapy with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison .\nThe ads claim that the government would \u201c jail parents for protecting their kids from harmful LGBTIQA+ ideology \u201d , and that NSW may even outlaw \u201c praying for someone you know in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nAccording to Equality Australia legal director Ghassan Kassisieh , \u201c This is predictable fearmongering about a bill that does not yet exist , but which is desperately needed to bring NSW laws into the 21st century.\n\u201d \u201c The truth is NSW has been lagging behind other states and

the member for Sydney on what this bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Many of Binary \u2019 s ads present the idea that children \u2014 and people in general , in some cases \u2014 should not be allowed to medically transition .\nThe ads feature the stories of people who underwent medical transition as adults and are now prominent detransitioners who have aligned with right-wing anti-trans groups .\nDetransitioners are people who decide to stop the process of gender transition or decide to no longer identify as transgender .\nTheir stories are compelling to right-wing groups who use detransition stories to argue that children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysphoria and are then pushed into making irreversible changes to their young bodies .\nThose that were included in Binary \u2019 s ads include Australians Ollie Davies and Jay Langadinos , who have both claimed that their medical transition occurred after psychiatric evaluations resulted in a diagnosis of gender dysphoria , which they both now believe to have been insufficient .\nDavies , who once tweeted he was a member of the international anti-trans organisation Genspect , has cited anecdotal evidence when telling The Australian that he believes \u201c a massive population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being pushed into the \u201c gender affirmative care pathway \u201d .\nDavies said he was not aware he had been used in Binary \u2019 s advertisements and that he had once tweeted that he was a member of Genspect but that the tweet had been taken out of context .\n\u201c When I said this , I was referring to the fact that I \u2019 d filled in a form on their website with my basic contact info and received a few emails from them with some helpful tips , \u201d Davies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crikey .\n\u201c This was after I \u2019 d exhausted every avenue I could think of in Australia \u2013 including organisations associated with the Pride Centre , my former trans health care provider , and support lines \u2013 and found nothing.\n\u201d Langadinos is currently suing her past psychiatrist for professional negligence , having detransitioned after previously undergoing a six-year medical transition that included hormone therapy , a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy .\nStatistics show detransition is uncommon , with one meta-analysis from March 2021 finding that in nearly 8000 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 1 % .\nGender-affirming medical treatment has been proven to save lives , lowering suicidality , and studies have found that post-surgery regret is far rarer compared to other , non-trans-related surgeries .\nFurthermore , there is often a misunderstanding about the reasons why people choose to detransition .\nIn a 2015 US transgender survey with responses from more than 27,000 people from all 50 US states , the top reasons for detransition , whether long- or short-term , were external factors such as pressure from parents and discrimination against them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of respondents who had detransitioned said gender transition was not for them , representing just 0.4 % of the overall sample .\nGroups like Binary that focus solely on detransitioners who no longer identify as transgender paint a highly misleading picture .\nIn a recent report by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism examining Australia \u2019 s far-right and extremist groups , Binary was listed as a hate group alongside other anti-trans organisations such as the LGB Alliance .\nBinary did not respond to a request for comment .\nThe organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming that Premier Daniel Andrews

damage \u201d debate .\nDeveloping countries argue that they should receive financial compensation for inevitable climate damages , given that it is mostly the rich that have caused climate change .\nThe moral case is sound , but the politics in most rich countries is firmly stacked against sending money to poorer countries as compensation , as distinct from support for actions to reduce emissions or help deal with climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger and bigger roadblock in climate negotiations .\nStepping back from controversies over money , the overarching topic for international climate policy is ambition .\nThe Paris Agreement framework is geared to continually ratchet up the ambition in countries \u2019 commitments to cut emissions .\nthat countries that had not yet updated their 2030 emissions targets should do so by now .\nBut only a few have done so , and the .\nThe next important marker will be countries \u2019 emissions targets for 2035 , and COP27 is a waypoint to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over coming years as governments focus on national security and energy affordability is uncertain .\nWhere geopolitical and energy pressure shifts policy and politics and especially where it has installed populist or right-wing governments , climate policy will tend to take a back seat .\nBut it may also come back strongly on the agenda .\nThis could come as a corollary of clean energy and industry policy , because of rising concerns about climate impacts , or as a way to strengthen international alliances between like-minded nations .\nThe short-term effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries are compensating for by slowing the shift away from coal and nuclear power , by building infrastructure to import gas from elsewhere , accelerating renewable energy deployment and saving energy .\nHigh energy prices in world markets encourage continued investment in new coal , oil and gas production , which runs counter to the climate objective .\nBut they also promote investment in clean energy supply , investments to use energy more efficiently , and shifting from fossil fuels to electricity for example through heat pumps and electric cars .\nThe sky-high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe \u2019 s big Russia lesson is that dependence on energy imports can be dangerous .\nDiversification of import sources helps , but there is a fundamental sense that a safe energy supply needs domestic energy production .\nFor any country not rich in fossil fuels this means renewable energy , or in some cases nuclear \u2014 climate-friendly options that also avoid the risk of future energy price shocks .\nIn the words of Germany \u2019 s finance minister , \u201c \u201d .\nThe new US gives huge subsidies for American clean energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries , as does and other .\nThe , in its flagship annual report released last week , finds that global clean energy investment is poised to rise quickly .\nFor countries strong in clean energy technology , there can be a positive feedback effect on climate policy .\nIf domestic industries benefit from the shift to zero carbon energy , then that is an extra reason for setting stronger emissions targets , and encouraging other countries to do the same .\nAnd those greater investments in advanced green technologies tend to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more affordable in developing countries .\nThis has been seen in the dramatic reductions in the cost of solar panels over the years , and it can be the case with other technologies from energy storage to electric cars .\nThe quest for industrial leadership in the shift to zero-emissions energy , industrial and transport systems holds real promise to drive global greenhouse gas emissions down .\nIn this light , the COP27 climate negotiations offer a chance for countries to affirm their commitment to cut emissions and strengthen their targets .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of affairs on climate finance .\nBut it could be helpful in keeping the global climate talks on a positive track in difficult times .\nFinally , the geopolitical shifts of this year may cause some countries to reposition on international climate action .\nNew alliances could emerge , and ideas like the could blossom .\nThe crisis of 2022 sets global climate action back in the first instance , but the shakeup also holds opportunity .", "author": "Frank Jotzo", "url":

theory: stairgate and the Republicanisation of Australian conservatism", "content": "After so many years of importing US culture war talking points and conspiracies , the Victorian Liberal Party could have set a template for the Republicans to follow .\nAs The New York Times sketches here , following the attack on Paul Pelosi , husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , baseless conspiracy theories made the hop , skip and jump from far-right fringe websites to mainstream media via senior figures in Republican politics .\nBut in a far more low-stakes way , Victorian state politics has its own version of this .\nIn March 2021 , while on holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped on a staircase and sustained a horrific back injury .\nFar-right politics researcher Cam Smith told Crikey that \u201c within hours \u201d of the news breaking of Andrews \u2019 accident on March 9 , right-wing anti-lockdown conspiracy groups on Telegram were posting content along the lines of \u201c I hope he was really bashed \u201d .\nSoon , this morphed into people in the same groups speculating on whether he had , and before long the same circles were posting that as though it were an actual rumour : \u201c I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups on Telegram posted the \u201c strange trend \u201d of politicians needing time off around this time ( former federal minister Greg Hunt was hospitalised around the same time and Christian Porter and Linda Reynolds were also taking leave for completely different reasons ) , ultimately concluding it may have something to do with adverse vaccine reactions .\nContributing to this were conspiratorial Facebook groups and pages \u2014 some with tens of thousands of followers \u2014 where conspiracies about Andrews \u2019 injury percolated beneath the surface of the mainstream for months .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise Staley .\nOn June 10 2021 , the then opposition treasurer and holder of the most marginal seat in the state put out a press release asking 12 questions of the recovering premier , including : \u2022 What is the address of the house where the accident occurred , and who owns it ?\n\u2022 Who called the ambulance and what time did it arrive ?\n\u2022 Were the police contacted and did they attend ?\n\u2022 Has Daniel Andrews been interviewed either informally or formally by the police in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nAs Michael Bradley noted in Crikey at the time , these questions alleged nothing but implied a great deal .\nStaley , for her part , was last seen briefly sharing the baseless rumour that a peaceful protester had been shot dead in Victoria during COVID lockdowns .\nAnd over the weekend , in one of those moves typical of the post-Trump era \u2014 somehow both shocking and drearily predictable \u2014 \u201c stairgate \u201d was resurrected on the front page of the Herald Sun , in dutiful campaign mode ahead of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece , again , alleges nothing in particular but notes , \u201c Neither the premier nor his office have ever fully detailed what he was doing in the days before the incident or exactly where it happened.\n\u201d And that , \u201c Several alternative theories about the fall have been put forward since the incident , mostly asserting that Mr Andrews was intoxicated and it happened at a function on the Monday afternoon or night.\n\u201d Beyond that , the piece reveals\u2026 that it was quite a small staircase the premier supposedly fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t play golf with the premier that weekend .\nThis may end up being a turning point in Australian politics : the online

intelligence officers being endangered , or foreign sources of intelligence being revealed .\nBut there \u2019 s no suggestion of that here .\nIn fact Australian governments are far too eager to invoke national security as a reason for secrecy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuation of the fiction that anything tangentially connected to national security must be treated as a subject above discussion by

.\nUnder his prime ministership , journalist Annika Smethurst and the ABC were raided by federal police goons .\nDavid McBride was prosecuted for revealing war crimes by ADF personnel .\nAnd the disgusting prosecution of two national heroes , Witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as vexatious a manner as possible , with Morrison \u2019 s government attempting to conduct the trial in secret using evidence Collaery was not allowed to see \u2014 all to cover up the crimes of the Howard government .\nAll of these related to good journalism or serious revelations of misconduct that deeply embarrassed security agencies and politicians .\nNone related to the vanity project of a discredited prime minister and his News Corp mates .\nBut Dreyfus \u2019 letter treats anything related to national security as above public debate \u2014 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Porter relied on to try to silence those who embarrassed them and their friends .\nAs for the \u201c expectation of discretion \u201d around cabinet discussions , that \u2019 s another tool to shut down transparency and accountability ( and which Morrison himself gleefully used for secrecy ) .\nThe Queensland government has already

overseas server \u2022 the ebook was \u201c distributed to a relatively small number of people \u201d and the individuals who distributed it were not acting in concert \u2022 Hardie Grant \u2019 s lawyers had already obtained damages from a number of individuals \u2022 the cumulative harm from the distribution was assessed as \u201c low \u201d .\nAfter discovering the ebook has been leaked , Hardie Grant and its lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book within Coalition and right-wing circles , including by Morrison staffer Nico Louw , with a \u201c family tree \u201d showing hundreds of copies of the book being emailed .\nHardie Grant secured damages from a number of distributors , including Louw .\nA number of Coalition recipients , including senior ministers , had deleted the emailed book without forwarding it .\nThe AFP has taken more than 18 months to decide that it will do nothing .\nTurnbull believes the AFP \u2019 s refusal to go any further reflects a view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness than physical theft .\nSpeaking to Crikey , Turnbull said , \u201c No doubt if you walked into Dymocks and took hundreds of copies of books out in a wheelbarrow , you \u2019 d be charged .\nBut the important point is that this involved the Prime Minister \u2019 s Office \u2014 it was the deliberate theft and distribution of hundreds of copies by people who worked in the heart of government , for the prime minister .\nThe object was to inflict commercial harm.\n\u201d The distribution of several hundred copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be much larger \u2014 led to News Corp running extracts from the book without authorisation from Turnbull or the publisher .\n\u201c When you think how seriously content industries have had to fight to defend intellectual property , and Parliament has responded to make it clearer that it is theft , \u201d said Turnbull , \u201c the next person to do something like this will be able to point to this decision and ask why they should be prosecuted when the Prime Minister \u2019 s Office wasn \u2019 t. \u201d Hardie Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the decision .\n\u201c If the PMO breaching copyright won \u2019 t attract police attention , what will ?\nThis undermines a law that is so important to publishers .\nDigital theft is not trivial \u2014 look at News Corp \u2019 s recent results \u2014 25 % of its revenue was from digital .\nThe AFP isn \u2019 t even sure how many copies were stolen.\n\u201d CEO of the Australian Publishers Association Michael Gordon-Smith told Crikey \u201c the treatment of Mr Turnbull \u2019 s book by Mr Morrison \u2019 s office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong for anyone to treat an author \u2019 s and a publisher \u2019 s property with such disrespect .\nFor the Prime Minister \u2019 s Office to do so was reprehensible .\nIt seemed that they had allowed a chance to express their personal animus to overcome their basic responsibilities.\n\u201d Gordon-Smith and APA president Lee Walker wrote to Morrison in April last

Andrews fans on social media see any critical reporting of the premier , however strongly evidenced , as a right-wing plot .\nLast week Nine newspapers \u2019 Paul Sakkal unearthed another scandal ,

of him is ill-founded and illegitimate .\nAs Andrews \u2019 continued strong polling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign over the years has done little to dent his success .\nHe heads into the election at the end

a secrecy clause that could hide national security corruption", "content": "While a joint parliamentary committee has unanimously recommended the passage of the government \u2019 s National Anti-Corruption Commission ( NACC ) bill , subject to minor amendments , the bill contains the potential for a future attorney-general to prevent the revelation of details of corruption in intelligence services or in any area affecting foreign policy or national security .\nSections 235 and 236 of the bill enable an attorney-general to prevent the disclosure of material that would \u201c prejudice the security , defence or international relations of Australia \u201d , prejudice Commonwealth-state relations , cabinet information , information on defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reveal information provided confidentially by another government .\nThe power is similar to that under part three of the National Security Information ( Criminal and Civil Proceedings ) Act 2004 , which enables an attorney-general to issue a certificate blocking the disclosure in federal criminal proceedings of national security information .\nChristian Porter used that power to keep details of the bugging of the Timor-Leste cabinet by ASIS and the Howard government secret .\nPorter also sought to use section 31 of the NSI Act to have Bernard Collaery \u2019 s case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ACT Court of Appeal .\nThere \u2019 s a recognition of these kinds of problems in the new bill .\nFor both sections , there \u2019 s a caveat : That , of course , was at the heart of the prosecutions of Witness K and Collaery and the vexatious manner in which it was conducted : an attempt to protect a long list of people , beginning with John Howard and Alexander Downer , and continuing through senior intelligence officials , bureaucrats and political advisers , some of whom later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revelation of their appalling conduct in relation to Timor-Leste .\nDreyfus and his drafters deserve acknowledgement for an effort to limit the capacity for misuse of the national security and international relations exemptions of the kind that was blatantly abused by the Coalition .\nAn attorney-general could also prevent the NACC from obtaining information in the first place \u2014 but that is limited to information provided to the government by a foreign government in confidence under a legally-binding international agreement .\nA spokesperson for the attorney-general pointed out that the certificate would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report about the corruption .\nBut the proposed sections give ample power to a future attorney-general to invoke 235 and 236 as a means to obscure the actions of , for example , a government that orders ASIS to spy on a friendly state for the purposes of helping a fossil fuel company that later offers employment to some of the perpetrators .\nIn that case , an attorney-general could argue the issue is not one of embarrassment of the perpetrators , but of damage to the national interest , the revelation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner workings of the national security committee of cabinet \u2014 not to mention damage to our relations with the victim state .\nThat is , Dreyfus \u2019 current drafting assumes that future attorneys-general will be committed to the national interest and be willing to do the right thing , when Australia \u2019 s recent experience is of attorneys-generals prepared to wage legal war on those who embarrass political allies and the intelligence services , despite clear evidence of significant and deeply damaging misconduct .\n\u201c The attorney-general \u2019 s ability to issue certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguards , \u201d Dreyfus \u2019 spokesperson noted \u2014 not just the \u201c embarrassment \u201d clause but that the decision would be appealable .\nCollaery fears that the power could be used in the future to hamper investigations \u2014 including into the government misconduct that led to his and Witness K \u2019 s prosecution .\n\u201c The proposed integrity commission will itself decide the extent to which inquiries may be retrospective , \u201d he told Crikey .\n\u201c If the current Coalition leadership gets back into power it can either again use similar NSI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively halt any inquiry into the events that lost and are still losing Timor-Leste and Australia billions of dollars.\n\u201d He points out that the NSI Act provisions can also \u201c be used in any prosecution arising from an integrity commission recommendation to prosecute .\nUntil the bill and the NSI Act are reformed we are no way forward.\n\u201d Any system that relies on good people doing the right thing will eventually break down , because eventually someone different will arrive and not do the right thing .\nThe system itself must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreyfus \u2019 mechanism , despite its attempts to address how the Coalition abused the NSI Act powers , risks exactly this mistake .",

election has become engulfed in controversy involving violent rhetoric , increasingly close ties between the Liberal Party and fringe groups , and claims of voter intimidation that led to an arrest .\nAn individual associated with the Freedom Party , Daniel Jones , was arrested after footage circulated on social media allegedly showing a man sticking a screw into a tyre of a car of an election observer .\nA Victorian Police spokesperson confirmed to Crikey that a 40-year-old Epping man had been charged with attempted criminal damage and released on bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader and former Queensland politician Aidan McLindon during his campaigning .\nHe \u2019 s also appeared in a campaign video for the party posted by party leader Morgan C Jonas .\nNeither Jones nor the Freedom Party responded to a request for comment .\nJonas , a prominent anti-vaccine campaigner and once engaged to anti-vaccine group Reignite Democracy Australia founder Monica Smit , started the Freedom Party after a split with Clive Palmer \u2019 s United Australia Party prior to this year \u2019 s federal election .\nThe party \u2019 s policies include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as criminalising \u201c gender transition therapy and surgery \u201d for minors .\nThe party has been increasingly promoting a \u201c stolen election \u201d claim in response to leaked footage of \u201c preference whisperer \u201d Glenn Druery requesting money for preference deals , and has called for the election to be postponed .\nThe Victorian Liberal Party is becoming increasingly enmeshed with these fringe claims .\nAfter being spotted at a protest organised by the Freedom Party outside of Premier Dan Andrews \u2019 office after the release of the Druery video , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Piastrino reiterated his calls for the election to be delayed .\n\u201c There has to be something put in place to investigate what seats have been bought , \u201d he said to 6 News .\nPiastrino also praised the Freedom Party and has been campaigning alongside its candidates during the election period .\nThis candidate \u2019 s increasingly close relationship with a fringe political party comes as the Victorian Liberal Party faces criticism over candidates with links to extreme organisations and comments .\nThe party \u2019 s state director , Sam McQuestin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election commission had made a \u201c serious , deliberate , and unprecedented interference \u201d into the election by referring an investigation about the party to the state \u2019 s corruption commission .\nThe party \u2019 s response was to jump on comments made by Deputy Premier Jacinta Allan saying that Victorian Liberal Leader Matthew Guy had preferenced \u201c Nazis \u201d on the Liberal campaign ticket , echoing previous lines used by Andrews .\nThe comments came in response to Angry Victorians Party candidate and current independent MP Catherine Cumming saying she wanted Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist \u201d .\nCumming made the statement at a protest flanked by Harrison Mclean , an organiser of Melbourne freedom movement rallies who boasted about using the events to introduce attendees to radical anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and had previously stated \u201c Hitler had some good points \u201d .\nIgnoring those comments , Liberal Party Deputy Leader David Southwick put out a release stating that Andrews and Allan must apologise .\nOthers have reported incidents of voter intimidation at pre-polling , with one Twitter user claiming at a pre-polling booth that they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c hanging Dan Andrews & others \u201d .\nMeanwhile , former Liberal MP and Democratic Labour Party candidate Bernie Finn \u2014 who had previously shared an image of Dan Andrews depicted as Hitler while in the Liberal partyroom \u2014 encouraged one of his Facebook followers to go confront other parties \u2019 volunteers .\nOn Friday , Finn posted on his Facebook : \u201c How can Victorian Socialists harassing people as they go into vote be legal ?\nThe VEC should stop them !\n\u201d One commenter asked : \u201c How do I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na go stir the pot .\n\u201d", "author": "Cam Wilson",

politically , organisationally and morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely and in every way unfit to take power and hold office .\nThis seems to me to be the obvious and key point to have emerged from this

poor shape , less than match fit , needing a bit of luck , etc , etc .\nIn fact it is a destroyed organisation , midway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation for numerous electoral breaches , studded with numerous unvetted candidates , honeycombed with weirdos , and preferencing neo-Nazis .\nFurthermore , it has nothing resembling a consistent program for the state , merely a mixed grab-bag of

results to the Sporting Globe copytaker , has taken time to produce a series of portentous takes veering weekly from the suggestion that Dictator Dan \u2019 s arrogance has lost a sure bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verge of being a one-party state .\nMeanwhile , in the Nein papers , around some good single electorate work is some hard spinning for the Coalition , as evidenced by this morning \u2019 s \u201c neck and neck !\n\u201d story , which goes on to reveal that Labor is leading by 53-47 2PP .\nTo call that number neck-and-neck in 2PP takes some neck .\nThese prevarications are required to avoid thinking about structural political change , and the central question of the collapse of Victorian liberalism .\nThere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded it , and now determine its form .\nThis event is perhaps less astounding to those under a certain age , because Victoria seems to be a \u201c natural \u201d Labor state , after a quarter-century of dominance .\nTo anyone else it \u2019 s hard to get used to , and for good reason .\nVictoria has not only been the intellectual and command section of Australian liberalism , it is really the first place in the world where a certain type of social-classical-liberalism came together in a stable and lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding barbarism .\nFrom the mid-19th century onwards , it was seen as a place where an ideal incorporating social protection and the guarantee of positive freedom could be fought for and won , without needing a man named Bismarck with a spike on his head to guarantee it .\nThe Harvester judgment , originated here in 1907 , and drawing on the Vatican \u2019 s Rerum Novarum of 1891 , is in that tradition , rather than a radical socialist one , and it really continued through the whole long chain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the turnip was of that ilk \u2014 Hamer , Cain/Kirner and urrrggghhh Malcolm Fraser ( who falsely believed himself to be a follower of Ayn Rand ) .\nThis was something achieved with difficulty , over generations , and had global influence .\nBut the spinning centre of it slowed , and in so doing became a dead weight and plunged , taking the whole edifice down with it .\nKennett turned the party into a spiv machine , breaking the alliance between principles and machine politics , which had proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , created the conditions for this publication ) , and persuading a whole generation of the liberal elite that this was not the place to put your efforts to create a better world , in a liberal framework .\nThe Age was lost to Fairfax , and then Fairfax was lost to a bunch

sometimes seems , is to make cheap shots on TV panels for elections his party is losing .\nWhatever benefits Kroger had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , arguably , gone when he re-took the party presidency , started a stupid losing fight with the Cormack Foundation , and took his eye off the party infrastructure , as Evangelicals , Mormons , and the Brighton crew under the improbably named Marcus Bastiaan ( one tries to think of analogues : Kingman Bridgespikes ?\nLorenzo Tongueslitter ? )\ntook over the whole apparatus .\nInterim leader Michael O \u2019 Brien never really had much of a chance to reverse the damage , having the unfortunate air of a lieutenant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before he is shot by his own men , and is thus unwilling to buy new winter trousers .\nThe Liberal Party of any type would have struggled against the political sophistication of Victorian Labor , which has had two decades to tune its politics to the contradictory demands of modern Victoria , a mix of muscular social progressivism combined with state-led economic vibrancy , a whiff of soft falangism ( \u201c Anzac \u201d metro station , \u201c police memorial tram stop \u201d ) , neoliberal asset management ( privatising the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a determination not to be outflanked outside of Melbourne ( by chopping all the trees down , so no one can sneak up ) .\nThe Liberals would have been back in the game by doing the mirror of Labor \u2019 s left-right crossover \u2014 i.e .\naccepting and continuing level crossings stuff , supporting social measures , and then standing for the individual and family on things like overdevelopment , the health system , Labor \u2019 s blundering land taxes , heritage , rural neglect , bad/rip-off suburban development , ministerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and so on .\nBut by then such audacity \u2014 recombining Hamerism with 21st century social and cultural values \u2014 was out of reach .\nThe Church of England was once described as the Conservative Party at worship .\nThe Victorian Liberal Party equivalent is now the Tarneit Dan Murphy Car Park Jesus is Awesome Ministry .\nSo it was in the worst possible situation when COVID came along , the world \u2019 s longest continuous lockdown was imposed , and vast anger \u2014 much of it reasonable in itself \u2014 surfaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act like Menzies \u2014 rather than more of the endless death-frotting of his political corpse \u2014 and run an iron wall down between the party and elements to the right of it .\nNow it needed a leader willing to wage brutal internal war , close whole branches , vacate positions , purge stack members .\nThis is what Labor was doing at the same time , in order to seal Adem Somyurek , the sultan of Springvale , back in his sarcophagus ( he \u2019 s there now ; it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomb called the Legislative Council ) .\nOnce again , the nerve failed , and it failed , where it did not in Labor , because , unlike Labor , Victoria \u2019 s Liberals could no longer feel they had anything worth fighting hard to keep .\nThe party stood for nothing consistent and binding , not even the idea of a sort of middle-class commonsense retail politics ; its offers have been erratic , poorly costed , contradictory and off the pace throughout .\nIts most energetic internal agents were loyal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the extremes becoming the centre , and the former party centre becoming a series of exile camps .\nThere is now so much former Liberal expertise and talent outside the party that another viable party could have been made of it .\nLeaving the hilarious gags aside for a moment , the decision to preference malign cookers such as the Angry Victorians is probably the Victorian Liberal Party \u2019 s greatest betrayal of itself , its history , its own members and the community as a whole .\nMatt Guy \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man on a Woman \u2019 s Weekly tour through the killing fields is the most pathetic failure to take a stab at getting the double \u2014 reaffirming principle and taking political advantage from it \u2014 of recent times .\nThe right knew what it was doing in following this trajectory , and that there were risks in doing it .\nBut it seems unlikely it understood quite how close the right , as a whole edifice , was to a sudden centre-periphery reversal .\nLook , it may pay off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every election is only provisionally forecast by the polls ; angry people don \u2019 t give an account of themselves to pollsters .\nAs one commentator remarked in the US midterms , response rates to polling are now at \u201c trace homeopathic \u201d levels .\nThis long Labor reign ( preferable on balance , but boy , sometimes \u2026 ) began with the shock of 1999 , from which the Liberal Party and much of its base never really recovered .\nShould its mirror occur , well , then the whole state has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re all in trouble .\nBut if it doesn \u2019 t , well , I don \u2019 t really see how one could say that the Victorian Liberal Party continues to exist in any real sense other than a letterhead .\nThere is no History in Africa , Hegel said .\nHe didn \u2019 t even bother to mention

biggest political advertising spend , pouring more than $ 400,000 to pump out 2750 ads .\nThey spent an additional $ 116,000 on 1146 ads published via its \u201c satire/parody \u201d account titled \u201c Matthew Guy \u2014 The Liberal Cuts Guy \u201d , plus $ 60,000 on Premier Daniel Andrews \u2019 account .\nThe Victorian Greens put more than $ 102,000 into 635 ads while the Liberals spent $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment from marketing and political strategist Toby Ralph is that there are no standout ads , but he gives the Liberal campaign more points than Labor \u2019 s \u201c surprisingly ineffectual \u201d pitch to voters .\n\u201c While hardly ready to pick up Cannes awards , [ the Liberal campaign ] appears to be narrowing the gap \u2014 but not to a particularly threatening extent , \u201d Ralph told Crikey , citing private polling that shows the Liberals roughly halved the distance between them and Labor over the course of the election .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ?\nCharacter assassination , scare campaign , or in-house policy promotion ?\nThe Labor government is on the offensive with a Matthew Guy-centric campaign that \u2019 s had the unintended effect of boosting the Liberal brand .\n\u201c Matt Guy is relatively unknown , so for Labor to give him prominence in attack ads appears to have lifted his name ID , \u201d Ralph said .\nThe primary social media series of \u201c Labor builds \u201d and \u201c Liberal cuts \u201d ads positions the Victorian Liberal leader as \u201c the cuts guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBe it the Big Build , additional healthcare workers , an airport link , free kindergarten , the so-called \u201c free-ing of TAFE \u201d , removal of level crossings , or reduction of power prices , the ads simply say Labor did or will do ( insert policy of choice ) and Liberals won \u2019 t .\nThere are also a few tropes on Guy \u2019 s so-called record on racism : accusations that \u201c Matthew Guy supports racists \u201d ( courtesy of Pauline Hanson ) and that the \u201c Liberals banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments from Guy that \u201c We can \u2019 t accept the whole world in Australia \u201d .\nIn the spirit of inclusivity , Victorian Labor launched another series declaring that it \u2019 s time to \u201c lock the gate \u201d on Guy \u2019 s cohort of Liberals who want to \u201c rip up Victoria \u2019 s ban on fracking \u201d .\nThis ad ( politely ) instructs Louise Staley , David Southwick , Jess Wilson , John Pesutto , James Newbury , and other Liberal candidates to \u201c frack off \u201d .\nAdam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent ad agency Thinkerbell , said attack ads are a high-stakes game for an incumbent .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a rare and silly move for the people in power to spend so much money shining a light on the opposition .\nIt just builds Matthew Guy \u2019 s salience.\n\u201d Ferrier also cites an unspoken rule in Australian politics that \u201c we respect those leaders who respect their opponents \u201d , and given the \u201c completely unelectable \u201d status of Guy , it reflects poorly on Andrews to be at the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c in contempt \u201d .\nThe Victorian Liberals deployed a similar strategy to Labor , opting to take down premier and Labor Leader Daniel Andrews .\nThere \u2019 s a stream of ads on Andrews \u2019 \u201c broken promises and excuses \u201d , including additional ICU beds , the all-encompassing field of \u201c the health crisis \u201d , a commitment to no new taxes and many more .\nThese are structured as \u201c do you remember when you promised [ insert promise of choice ] \u201d or \u201c what happened to [ same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews declaring \u201c I can \u2019 t specifically recall \u201d .\nOther ads urge voters to hold Andrews to account and \u201c don \u2019 t let him get away with it \u201d .\nHow so ?\nThe ads offer a solution to \u201c Put Labor last \u201d .\nThere \u2019 s a spot on the consequences of voting Labor coined the \u201c Andrews \u2019 hangover \u201d .\nThe video goes : \u201c Oh no , what did we do yesterday \u2026 [ sigh ] we \u2019 re gon na pay for this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don \u2019 t wake up with an Andrews \u2019 hangover \u201d .\nRalph called it a \u201c superficially brave \u201d and \u201c unconventional \u201d strategy to frame a leader as popular as Andrews as a \u201c symbol of incompetence or annoyance \u201d but acknowledged there was cut-through .\n\u201c The campaign appears to have tapped a binary vein of discontent , particularly in the Western suburbs.\n\u201d Ralph said it \u2019 s indicative of

.\nPeterson , a self-described \u201c politically incorrect \u201d Canadian psychologist , revealed the details of his conversation with the former Australian prime minister in an exclusive , if

And you don \u2019 t save the planet either , but you definitely hurt people who are poor , \u201d Peterson said .\nPeterson spoke to Crikey hours after he gave a speech to a select group of conservative politicians in a lecture hall in Parliament that was closed to the public .\nThe Australian reported Peterson told the audience , which included Morrison , ex-deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce , and One Nation Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c fight for cheaper energy , smaller government and the nuclear family \u201d .\nAfterwards , Peterson tweeted a picture of himself alongside Morrison with his hand on the ex-PM \u2019 s shoulder , and told his 3.5 million followers the pair had discussed a \u201c renewed classic liberal/conservative vision \u201d .\nCrikey asked Peterson what that meant and got the following response : \u201c Well , it was partly an extended discussion of similar policies .\nAnd policies that I \u2019 ve been discussing with centrists around the world .\nBut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 it \u2019 s fine , you can investigate diverse energy sources and hopefully cleaner ones , but yeah , they can \u2019 t be more expensive , because that \u2019 s not a

, I thought that he was\u2026 what was my impression ?\n\u201d Peterson said .\n\u201c Well , we had a fine conversation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy policy .\nI was very interested in talking to him about his reactions to events like COP26 , which he was not impressed by .\n\u201c And I asked him why , and it was for reasons , I presume , he thought that it was mostly posture , which it is , and it was

"This article is based on Kevin Rudd \u2019 s Richard Larkins Oration delivered at Monash University on Wednesday night .\nIf humanity is to avoid a bloody war over Taiwan , we all need a clear understanding of what such a confrontation might actually look like .\nWe now live in a dangerous time .\nAlthough the Chinese Communist Party is not on a general war footing in preparation for an imminent invasion , Chinese President Xi Jinping has now prioritised security squarely above economics .\nThe Chinese president \u2019 s report to October \u2019 s 20th Party Congress shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China \u2019 s external security environment : instead of \u201c peace and development \u201d as \u201c the main trend of our time \u201d , Xi emphasises \u201c dangers in peacetime \u201d and preparation for the \u201c dangerous storm \u201d .\nThis confirms our analysis that a clear danger zone is emerging in the late 2020s and early 2030s , when China believes it will have sufficiently narrowed its military gap with the United States and insulated itself against financial sanctions .\nChina is also watching for weakening US and allied political resolve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president in 2024 , 2028 or 2032 .\nI continue to be worried about the ease ( or , in some cases , excitement ) with which some public figures talk loosely about the possibility of war .\nI include in this our alternative prime minister , Peter Dutton , who as defence minister declared it \u201c inconceivable \u201d that Australia would not join such a war \u2014 as though we are discussing some minor re-run of Margaret Thatcher in the Falklands , rather than a conflagration that could lead to World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion to think clearly about the different war scenarios that go beyond the classical image of a military invasion .\nOne possibility is that China could blockade Taiwan to strangle its economy , either through its now formidable naval assets or the threat of conventional rocket forces \u2014 capabilities we saw on display in China \u2019 s reaction to US Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s visit in August .\nSuch actions by China are likely to invite a US naval and air response .\nAlternatively , China could launch a comprehensive cyberattack with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian and military infrastructure .\nThis would also invite American and Taiwanese countermeasures against Chinese critical infrastructure , enhancing the risk of non-cyber escalation given the vulnerability of military assets cut off from communications systems .\nA third possibility is China attempting to take one of Taiwan \u2019 s offshore islands .\nAny Taiwanese government would face irresistible political pressure to defend its territorial integrity .\nThe Chinese may gamble that American leaders could not justify a military response to their own people in defence of some distant island , and cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve .\nFourth , China could still embark on a full-scale territorial invasion that , if it were to succeed , would probably involve a combined amphibious , airborne and special-forces operation bigger than the D-Day landings in 1944 .\nThis is the most problematic scenario of all , involving possible pre-emptive strikes on American military assets in nearby Guam , which is sovereign US territory , and Japan .\nIt could also trigger US strikes against Chinese missile forces in Fujian .\nNeedless to say , under this scenario , the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid .\nAdd to all of these scenarios the risk of nuclear escalation if China were to begin losing a conventional war .\nIn such a circumstance , it would be unwise to rule out the possible threat or use of nuclear weapons to safeguard the regime .\nThe real-world consequences of any such war would be of an order of magnitude not seen in our lifetimes .\nThe civilian casualties on Taiwan \u2014 an island democracy of about 25 million people \u2014 would be impossible to predict .\nTaiwanese repeatedly tell pollsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNikkei estimates the global economic cost of war would immediately evaporate about 3 % of global GDP and bring about a global depression .\nIf China prevailed , it would upend the prevailing regional security order and undermine the credibility of US security guarantees to its treaty allies in Asia and Europe .\nAustralia \u2019 s economy would massively contract .\nWe would also face the mass exodus of refugees seeking safety from war zones .\nFurthermore , if America failed , we would face the possibility of funding our own form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 a profound challenge given our population size , vast geography and , at present , limited military resources .\nWe can not imagine how the global order would be reshaped by such a war .\nWhat we know is that the first and second world wars both radically remoulded the world in ways that could not have been anticipated .\nThese questions demand serious , mature discussion .\nIt is to all our benefit that Prime Minister Albanese has taken the temperature down in Australia-China relations in his recent meeting with President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good that presidents Biden and Xi had done likewise for the US-China relationship for the immediate period ahead .\nBut for us , the core strategic challenge for medium- to long-term US-China and Australia-China relations outlined above should no longer be kicked around as a domestic political football \u2014 either to win favour within the internal politics of the tawdry conservative political ecosystems of the Liberal and National parties , or as an attempted electoral wedge against Labor for being allegedly soft on China , as Dutton and Morrison sought to do during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are three core questions within this debate : first , how to manage the unfolding strategic competition between China and the US to reduce the risk of crisis , conflict and war by accident over the decade ahead ; secondly , whether a combination of military , financial , economic , technological and political deterrence can be effectively deployed to cause the Chinese leadership to conclude , by the late \u2018 20s and early \u2018 30s , that the risks of war by design against Taiwan , the US and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger ; and , finally , if war occurs , to consider the consequences of either Chinese or American failure .\nThese are the biggest questions this country has faced in its national security and foreign policy since World War II .\nAnd they require our focused national attention .", "author": "Kevin

those statements , Morrison said he didn \u2019 t want ministers second-guessing themselves so he kept Mathias Cormann , Josh Frydenberg and Karen Andrews in the dark , and he didn \u2019 t want the public to know because it would be \u201c misinterpreted and misunderstood , which would have caused unnecessary angst \u201d .\nMorrison should have left it there .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying even when he doesn \u2019 t have to , he then went further .\nOn November 4 , Tsacalos wrote to Bell to tell her Morrison \u2019 s memory has been jogged .\nBut what did Morrison think was the \u201c usual practice \u201d ?\nBell asked Tsacalos , and Tsacalos wrote back : \u201c At the time of the appointments , the subject of the inquiry , Mr Morrison , had no reason to understand otherwise than that PM & C \u2019 s usual practice was to arrange publication in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the offices they held \u2014 irrespective of whether a minister was sworn in at Government House or not .\nNaturally , he expected that this usual practice would be followed.\n\u201d That was a clear sign that Morrison was lying .\nAnd just to make it clearer , the lawyer added : This statement makes zero sense .\nIf Morrison didn \u2019 t want ministers to know he \u2019 d been sworn into their portfolios , as he said , that \u2019 s utterly inconsistent with his professed belief that in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & C as \u201c the usual practice \u201d .\nAs Bell notes : \u201c Mr Morrison \u2019 s assumption that all the appointments were notified to the public in the Gazette is not easy to reconcile with his conduct at the time or with his public statements when the appointments came to light.\n\u201d In fact , it \u2019 s utterly implausible that Morrison both thought the appointments would be gazetted and that the relevant ministers would remain unaware .\nDitto the public .\nMorrison said he didn \u2019 t want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public and would be \u201c misinterpreted \u201d , but also that he expected the appointments to be made public via the Gazette .\nIn Bell \u2019 s words : \u201c While few members of the public may read the Gazette , any idea that the gazettal of the prime minister \u2019 s appointment to administer the treasury ( or any of the other appointments ) would not be picked up and quickly circulated within the public service and the Parliament strikes me as improbable in the extreme .\nFinally , Mr Morrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 17 August 2022 about his failure not only to inform his ministers but also to inform the public of the appointments .\nThe omission on that occasion to state that he had acted at all times on the assumption that each appointment had been notified to the public in the Gazette is striking.\n\u201d Striking is one word .\nBlatant falsehood is another .\nMorrison as prime minister never knew when to stop lying .\nIt seems he still doesn \u2019 t .\nShould Scott Morrison be forced to resign ?\nLet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crikey.com.au

[ Victorian Electoral Commission ] ladies , \u201d says Ben Schultz , adding that he saw their eyes widen in unison .\n\u201c Down your pants ?\nAs distinct from , say , the pocket of your pants ?\n\u201d , I ask .\nYes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Animal Justice Party campaign director went on to explain .\nDespite months of careful negotiations and rigorous preparation , as well as the stress associated with the promise and peril of empty assurances , Schultz had found himself at the eleventh hour on the 11th floor of 530 Collins Street almost irrevocably unprepared for his moment .\nAdding to the toll , his phone was abuzz with messages from \u201c preference whisperer \u201d Glenn Druery , demanding to know his whereabouts .\n\u201c Hiding [ the envelope ] down my pants wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2018 Shit , what if I get bailed up or hit over the head or something ?\n\u2019 \u201d he said , referencing the possibility other parties might spy his ruse .\n\u201c So there wasn \u2019 t really a choice in the end.\n\u201d Midday that fateful day marked the deadline for every party to register its group voting tickets ( GVTs ) with the VEC , with the full candidates \u2019 list and ballot draws for each electorate only released two days before \u2014 on the Friday .\nHours earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , as arranged , met Druery at Druery \u2019 s hotel in Melbourne , along with a friend of Druery \u2019 s , who Schultz described as nothing short of a \u201c leprechaun \u201d .\n\u201c He , the leprechaun , was really intense , \u201d he says .\n\u201c He was telling me , \u2018 You \u2019 ve got to preference the Shooters , you must preference the Shooters , and I was like , \u2018 Jesus , man , we \u2019 re the Animal Justice Party \u2019 .\n\u201d Druery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false impression that he \u201c had the Animals \u201d , and that the party would , as instructed , preference Druery \u2019 s \u201c cabal of riff-raff parties \u201d before Fiona Patten \u2019 s Reason Party .\nThe quid pro quo was a seat for Animal Justice candidate Georgie Purcell , Andy Meddick \u2019 s former chief of staff .\nBut after decades of micro-parties largely depending on Druery for his near-reverential insights and advice for upper house election , Schultz went the other way .\n\u201c The whole old white dudes club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly the idea of preferencing the Lib Dems over Fiona for our own gain was unconscionable , \u201d he said .\nAnd so , Schultz set out to destroy Druery \u2019 s alliance of micro-parties and reduce Druery to a figure of self-parody .\nTo Schultz \u2019 s mind , the entire ruse that day was more or less going to plan until Druery asked him for a lift into the VEC : \u201c The problem was I had my envelope of GVTs on the back seat \u2014 it was such a stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner to phone me and demand I come home , which she did.\n\u201d ( He added proudly that he \u201c played the whipped partner to perfection \u201d . )\nThe icing on the cake , says Schultz , would have been to come face to face with Druery afterwards , when the VEC had published the GVTs and the full weight of his deception was unveiled for the world to see .\nBut it wasn \u2019 t to be .\nInstead , he says , he had to make do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ of the VEC ] , I smiled at the leprechaun and he said , \u201c Is that all you \u2019 ve got to say for yourself ?\n\u2019 , and I said , \u2018 No , tell Druery I wanted to see the whites of his eyes \u2019 .\n\u201d When pressed to explain his choice of words , Schultz says : \u201c You see , the thing you might not know about Druery is that he has all these war analogies \u2014 like , when you \u2019 re in hand-to-hand combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the whites of their eyes .\n\u201c So it was just a really poetic moment for me to say that , and his mate , the leprechaun , passed the message on .\nAnd of course , I got to say it later over the phone , so that was really nice.\n\u201d A few days on from the election , the prevailing view is that Druery \u2019 s grip on the upper house has been broken , with his alliance of parties all going backwards .\nDerryn Hinch \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgraced former ALP powerbroker Adem Somyurek , running for the DLP , will probably be pipped at the post by Patten .\nDruery , for his part , downplayed the significance of Schultz \u2019 s move , focusing instead on Schultz \u2019 s dishonesty .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t a sting operation ; it was just a rat .\nThey absolutely lied to me and ratted on all the other minor parties that helped them , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They think they can come in and act like they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the place and run out without paying the bill .\nWell , no .\nTrust is trust and truth is truth .\nAnd to be dishonest means you \u2019 re dishonest.\n\u201d Druery added that he felt \u201c really betrayed and taken advantage of \u201d .\nSchultz , however , assures Crikey he \u2019 s aware of Druery \u2019 s hurt feelings .\nTo prove the point , he texted a screenshot of a Twitter exchange between the two , where Schultz \u2014 responding to Druery \u2019 s question \u201c Why were @ @ @ @

doing nothing in paternalism", "content": "From the outset , the Nationals have been hostile to an Indigenous Voice to Parliament .\nIn 2017 , then party leader Barnaby Joyce falsely claimed after the Uluru Statement from the Heart that it would constitute a third chamber : \u201c It just won \u2019 t fly.\n\u201d In 2019 , while on the backbench , he admitted he was wrong on the third chamber claim .\nIn October Joyce was back at it , disgustingly comparing a Voice to Parliament to Nazi Germany .\nThe official line from the Nationals is no longer an outright lie , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Voice will do nothing for Indigenous peoples .\nIn August , Nationals Leader David Littleproud insisted that a Voice would be \u201c another speech with no actual outcome \u201d and wouldn \u2019 t \u201c shift the dial \u201d on Indigenous welfare .\nIn formally opposing a Voice yesterday , Littleproud went further .\nIt would be \u201c another layer of bureaucracy here in Canberra \u201d , said it wouldn \u2019 t be \u201c a Voice for regional , rural and remote Australians .\nThis is one for those who live in Redfern.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dial \u201d , he repeated .\nThis argument that a Voice would have no practical benefit for Indigenous peoples is likely to become the polite , politically correct excuse to oppose it .\nIt echoes Opposition Leader Peter Dutton \u2019 s justification for walking out on the Apology to Australia \u2019 s Indigenous peoples in 2008 \u2014 that it wouldn \u2019 t have any real impact .\nIts deeper antecedent is John Howard \u2019 s opposition to doing pretty much anything at all in cooperation with Indigenous peoples , on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d , not \u201c symbolic \u201d , reconciliation .\nAs Howard showed , emphasising \u201c practical \u201d reconciliation led to no reconciliation of any kind \u2014 which was the point .\nIt \u2019 s exactly the point for the Nationals and , very likely , the Dutton-led Liberals .\nDutton was peddling the \u201c third chamber \u201d lie even as Joyce was admitting it was false .\nThe \u201c practical \u201d / \u201d symbolic \u201d juxtaposition is one of those clever right-wing framings used to short-circuit pursuing rational , evidence-based policy .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate action \u2014 or any environmental action \u2014 as being all about \u201c environment \u201d v \u201c jobs \u201d .\nIt always sounds reasonable \u2014 who could oppose practical action for Indigenous peoples , any more than oppose more jobs ?\nBut it \u2019 s always a cloak for inaction that serves the interests of the powerful .\nThe evidence base for years of Indigenous policy across health , education and economic engagement is that what works \u2014 i.e .\nthe precious practical benefits \u2014 is what is co-designed and co-implemented with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few positives of the Morrison government on any policy front was a commitment to building more and more capacity within Indigenous

30 % of women voting for it compared with 37 % of men , and the loss of six seats to female independent candidates \u2014 has determined that nothing really needs to be done about the fact that women

retiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and Shelley Hancock in South Coast will be replaced by a male .\nThe failure to lift the number of female MPs in NSW can partly be put down to the dominance in Liberal branches of elderly , out-of-touch members whose idea of a politician is a white male , and the fact that reforms to increase party democracy within the NSW branch have had the perverse effect of ensuring the Liberal Party looks less and less like the community it purports to serve .\nInternal party democracy is no guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a problem for the Liberals than for Labor , which also has an elderly membership , but has a formalised faction system , a substantial role for trade unions , which are increasingly dominated by feminised industries , and quotas for women .\nBut the

extract from The Teal Revolution : Inside the Movement Changing Australian Politics by Margot Saville , our latest Crikey Read .\nIn an existential sense , what does the rise of the teals mean for the future of mainstream political parties ?\nWhat could the federal Parliament look like in three or four elections \u2019 time ?\nAt this election , the Coalition suffered its worst result in 70 years , losing an unprecedented 18 seats .\nAccording to journalist George Megalogenis , the Liberals ( plus the Queensland LNP ) , which had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84 urban electorates , lost half of them .\nThere is only one Liberal MP in Adelaide and Perth , and none in Hobart , Canberra and Darwin .\nBut the Labor Party can \u2019 t afford to look smug ; it only picked up nine of them \u2014 two went to the Greens , and the historically Labor-held seat of Fowler went to independent Dai Le .\nIn fact , the two major parties recorded their lowest-ever share of the vote in 2022 : just under 70 % .\nIf this trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few elections before minority or hung parliaments become the norm and our parliament starts to look more like Germany \u2019 s \u2014 a patchwork of small parties and alliances .\nThe Coalition , in particular the Liberal Party , has been fundamentally reshaped by the latest ballot .\nAt the time of the 2011 census , the Liberals held 16 out of the top 20 seats by average household income , according to political scientist William Bowe .\nBut since the last election , the urban conservative has gone on the endangered list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just four inner-metropolitan seats ( as defined by the AEC ) : the south-western Sydney seat of Banks , Bradfield in Sydney \u2019 s upper North Shore , Scott Morrison \u2019 s seat of Cook in the southern suburbs of Sydney and the Adelaide seat of Sturt formerly held by Christopher Pyne .\nThere \u2019 s a strong correlation between education , income and living in the inner city ; electorates like Wentworth and Kooyong are prime examples of this .\nElection analyst Ben Raue has been charting this group \u2019 s voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last election , the Coalition held 15 of the most highly educated seats ( more than 25 % of the voting population with a bachelor \u2019 s degree or higher ) , a figure which fell to four after the ballot , he said .\nIt also went from 24 of the richest electorates ( median weekly income of $ 800 to $ 1249 ) to nine , and as above , lost 12 of their previous total of 16 inner-metropolitan seats ( well-established , built-up suburbs in capital cities ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 10 of the bottom-ranked seats by household income , which was not the case 10 years ago .\nBowe said that there was a fundamental realignment going on in the politics of the two-party , centre-right and centre-left political systems of the English-speaking world .\nWhat was once a socio-economic class-based division is now harder to categorise .\nSome observers call it the \u201c Nowheres v the Somewheres \u201d , he told me .\n\u201c Namely the cosmopolitan globalised knowledge class versus the people who have a lower level of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , of a kind of communal identity with their country and to a certain extent their race.\n\u201d At the moment , there \u2019 s a war going on within the Liberal Party about whether or not they embrace this new division , the analyst said .\nElection post-mortems have focused on the deliberate attempt by Morrison to sacrifice the teal electorates in order to try to win Labor \u2019 s outer-suburban seats .\n\u201c They were really making a pitch for the high-vis-vest-wearing vote , the mining industry vote , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor vote , and they imagined that they weren \u2019 t in trouble in the seats that they ended up losing , \u201d he said .\nThe Liberal losses at the last election have also led to a shift inside the Coalition .\nBecause the National Party and the Queensland LNP now hold 31 of the 58 seats , Queensland is the new centre of power , reflected in the election of party leaders Peter Dutton and David Littleproud .\nIt \u2019 s hard to see how these two men , based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will inspire voters in Kooyong and Wentworth to return their votes to the fold .\nIt \u2019 s not just in the federal sphere that the Coalition vote has declined .\nCanberra-based psephologist Ian McAuley has been maintaining a table of the Coalition \u2019 s fortunes in state and federal elections , from the Victorian state election in November 2014 to the present .\nHe says that the 2022 federal election was the \u201c 19th of those elections in which the Coalition \u2019 s primary vote has gone backwards \u201d .\nAround the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state governments , in NSW and Tasmania .\nThe NSW Coalition government of Dominic Perrottet , currently in minority , is pursuing a progressive economic and social agenda in advance of an election in March 2023 , while the Tasmanian Liberal government of Jeremy Rockliff governs with a one-seat majority .\nThese poor electoral showings have led to speculation about the future of the Liberal Party \u2014 has it reached an electoral tipping point ?\nThere \u2019 s an intense debate inside the party about its future direction .\nSomeone with a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political parties is Malcolm Turnbull .\nThe former PM said that \u201c it was a long road back for the Liberal Party because politics is very unpredictable .\nIf Scott Morrison was a turn-off , which he clearly was , Dutton is worse .\nMatt Kean is the only thing that they \u2019 ve got going for them at the moment \u201d .\nANU professor Frank Bongiorno has speculated that Australia \u2019 s major political parties are \u201c broken , possibly beyond repair \u201d .\nHe highlighted the irony of the major parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in essence , a political party .\nA more justified accusation might be that in important ways the major parties themselves have ceased to be mass democratic parties , he said .\n\u201c Today , the parties conform to what political scientists call the \u2018 electoral-professional \u2019 model .\nThis is a worldwide phenomenon , whereby mass parties of the traditional kind give way to organisations that consist largely of their parliamentary representatives and paid functionaries \u2014 a melting iceberg with a small tip and not much below the waterline.\n\u201d In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conform to even the basic standards that most Australians would associate with democratic governance \u201d , he wrote .\n\u201c Factional warlords and party officers exercise overwhelming power .\n\u201c Still , the independents , and especially those generated by the \u2018 Voices Of \u2019 movement that began with Cathy McGowan in the Victorian regional seat of Indi \u2026 are offering a form of public leadership that , with some exceptions , has not flourished recently in the major parties .\n\u201c It is notable that their favourite causes \u2014 climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among those that the major parties have managed most poorly .\nThese are issues where there has often been a radical mismatch between public opinion and party action.\n\u201d Click here to buy The Teal Revolution : Inside the Movement Changing Australian Politics by Margot Saville .\nWhat lessons should the major parties

professionals , actors , as well as museum and art gallery staff are among the industries that have reported the highest levels of sexual harassment in the workplace over the past five years , according to a new report .\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission surveyed 10,000 workers and found overall that one in three had experienced some form of sexual harassment at work , though media ,

the rate of harassment in that industry was a dismal 80 % \u2014 still \u201c terrible compared to the national average .\nBut it looks like there has been a change \u201d , Jenkins said .\nSome 44 % of workers in the arts and recreation industry reported experiencing harassment , while in retail , as well as electricity , gas , water and waste services , it was 40 % .\nIn hospitality , the rate of harassment was 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers in the male-dominated industry of construction reported instances of sexual harassment , while in scientific and technical circles it was similarly low at 15 % .\nThe report found 77 % of harassers were male ( though a quarter of men reported instances of sexual harassment too ) .\nTwo in five women reported that they had been sexually harassed at work \u2014 mostly younger women \u2014 while groups reporting higher than average rates included those who identified as LGBTQA+ ( 46 % ) , people with an intersex variation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 56 % ) , and those with a disability ( 48 % ) .\nIn a statement , Jenkins called the 2022 results \u201c disappointing \u201d but remained hopeful the Respect @ Work Bill passing on a positive duty to all employers will see the next survey in 2027 reflect much lower rates of harassment in the workplace .\n\u201c The actions that governments and workplaces around Australia are now taking will have an impact , but it will take time .\nI urge them to continue implementing change now , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey may be greatly improved , \u201d Jenkins said .\nAlmost three-quarters of respondents told the survey they believed their workplace leaders were committed to creating a safe working environment free from sexual harassment .\nSo what should business leaders do ?\nFay Calderone , a partner at Hall and Wilcox and workplace law expert , says the most important change to note is that workplaces can \u201c no longer be reactive \u201d to these issues .\n\u201c Isolated responses to complaints without acknowledging and addressing the systemic and cultural drivers that underpin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Calderone said .\nThat \u2019 s because of the \u201c cornerstone \u201d of the Respect @ Work Bill \u2014 the inclusion of a positive duty for employers and persons conducting a business or undertaking ( PCBUs ) to prevent workplace sex discrimination , harassment and victimisation .\nThe survey , which was conducted for the commission by Roy Morgan Research , found only half of respondents had been told by their employer about how to report an incident , while just two in five said they had attended training addressing sexual harassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of keeping perpetrators on staff for reasons like their contribution to the business \u2019 s bottom line , saying the tide had well and truly turned .\n\u201c It is now more critical than ever that policies are consistently and indiscriminately enforced , no matter who the perpetrator is and regardless of their perceived \u2018 value \u2019 to the organisation , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The cost to the organisation of inappropriate , unhealthy and disrespectful behaviours will always outweigh any top line benefit a perpetrator is perceived as bringing in.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the cost to employee health and safety is far too high , while inaction or paltry consequences in lieu of serious discipline is an impediment to the \u201c creation of diverse , healthy and inclusive workplaces \u201d .\n\u201c The physical , psychological and economic impact on survivors is catastrophic .\nThe culture of our

"content": "Scott Morrison has been censured by the House of Representatives .\nBut are there any real-world consequences for the former prime minister ?\nThere are several answers to that question depending on your perspective .\nTo Morrison himself , if his self-gratifying speech on the censure motion \u2014 not so much a defence as an audible raspberry \u2014 is any guide , it \u2019 s just another minor sling/arrow to shrug off his broad Christian shoulders as he continues along his shambling path to divine rapture .\nFor the social media generation , it must all seem oddly pointless .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kicked out of Parliament ?\nNo .\nLose some salary ?\nNo .\nOn the contrary , he \u2019 ll be back on Facebook tomorrow , still pulling public money and promoting his wares as a globalisation genius while facing zero consequences .\nThe Coalition , apart from Bridget Archer , performatively agreed on its futility .\nA stunt , they labelled it , although why they felt it necessary to underline their collective amorality by going up to Morrison and shaking his hand , I don \u2019 t know .\nPerhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hasn \u2019 t lost them yet and they want to complete the set .\nThe reality is that Morrison \u2019 s censure is a nothing-burger .\nParliament regulates itself but gave up the power to expel its members long ago .\nA censure is symbolic and has no legal consequence , and won \u2019 t even affect his credit rating \u2014 though it will definitely improve his chances of a gig on Sky after dark .\nIn earlier times , it would have meant more .\nWhen the national discourse was led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , when we learnt what we needed to know from the morning papers and the evening news , this story would have run for days .\nNot quite at \u201c The King is dead \u201d or \u201c Bradman \u2019 s out \u201d levels , but it would have been significant .\nThat notion is quaint now .\nPlus , most of the population won \u2019 t even be aware that Morrison has been censured , or what for , or care much if they find out .\nHowever , it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this moment \u2019 s significance .\nHe is the first former prime minister of this country to be censured by his own house of Parliament .\nLosing a 86-50 vote , against the entire crossbench and one from their own party , the Coalition voted to avoid , en bloc , against a motion that was unarguably right .\nThe House has always had the power , and incoming governments have always had the numbers , to do this to their predecessors .\nYet never before have they taken the extraordinary step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , not even Tony Abbott did it .\nSo that \u2019 s how the record will stand .\nWhat Morrison did to warrant censure was unprecedented , a gross assault on the conventions of responsible government and a shattering of principles that had worked comfortably for 120 years .\nIt was an act of constitutional vandalism , one that has forced Parliament to implement new laws to prevent it happening again .\nHistory will also reflect that Morrison didn \u2019 t care when he was caught red-handed , instead continuing to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his self-inflicted humiliation .\nAnd it will note that his colleagues voted for party instead of the national interest .\nMost importantly , though , history will record that Morrison was called a

, she was a direct challenge to the powerful \u2014 a challenge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of other brave women from a variety of backgrounds and for differing causes , became symbols and leaders of a groundswell of anger about gender and workplace issues .\nBut that deep-seated anger \u2014 the fury and dismay of women , and many men , sick of pervasive misogyny , of double standards , of justice systems that treat women and children as second-class citizens , of the casual use of power purely in the interests of privileged males \u2014 is no match for a system and institutions built and designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment since she emerged in 2021 has been a reaction to the threat she posed , regardless of the merits of her allegations against Bruce Lehrmann , who maintains his innocence .\nA Coalition politician allegedly linked her drinking with her alleged rape , though he denies having done so .\nSenator Linda Reynolds , a senior minister and Higgins \u2019 former

the subject of a prime ministerial lie to Parliament .\nReynolds \u2019 partner attended the trial , at which the minister was to give evidence , and Reynolds texted suggestions to defence lawyers for Lehrmann .\nAfter the director of public prosecutions discontinued the prosecution out of concern for Higgins \u2019 health , an Australian Federal Police source leaked information to News Corp attempting to undermine the prosecution .\nToday News Corp has continued to try to do so .\nThat is , it \u2019 s not merely the criminal justice system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an allegation of sexual assault successfully prosecuted , or to endure any prosecution without being subjected to ferocious personal attack , but broader systems of power that will work to inflict exemplary punishment on women perceived as a threat .\nThe office of the prime minister .\nHis department .\nJournalists and commentators .\nThe AFP .\nThe Coalition \u2019 s propaganda unit , News Corp .\nCoalition backbenchers and ministers .\nEach of the perpetrators , from Phil Gaetjens through to Janet Albrechtsen and every politician , staffer , AFP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully culpable for their actions .\nBut they are also part of a systemic response to a perceived threat .\nImagine what a different dynamic might have played out if Higgins had alleged she was assaulted by a staffer from another political party , or if she had alleged she \u2019 d been assaulted by a male who could be othered \u2014 a person of colour , a welfare recipient , an immigrant .\nBut because she alleged she was sexually assaulted by a Liberal staffer , and Liberal ministers failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredited the political party in power at the time , she was the target of a systemic response .\nThus the anger at the failure of the criminal justice system to resolve her allegations \u2014 to the extent that the criminal justice system can ever resolve such things \u2014 and the anger at the behaviour of journalists , MPs and lawyers , is at risk of being misdirected purely at the individuals concerned , when they acted as part of a system of power that worked to protect itself from a threat .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many hundreds of Indigenous victims of police homicide over decades , have learnt to see the persistent failure of any prosecution of a police officer for homicide as part of a broader system of racial oppression , a continuing legacy of colonialism and dispossession and the self-protective workings of a justice system of which police are an integral part , the failure of \u201c

of justified outrage about individual incidents rarely leads to systemic change , even in the rare event an individual perpetrator is appropriately punished .\nIn the Higgins case , regardless of the truth of the allegations against Lehrmann , the systemic failings of the criminal justice system formed part of a much greater systemic response directed at punishing and destroying Higgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the anger about her treatment , there is nothing that would stop the same punishment being meted out to another woman perceived as a threat to the powerful .\nThe systems and networks that

killed her .\nIncredible sabotage .\nStill , they got what they wanted : the now-vacant Senate slot went to the Shorts \u2019 Jana Stewart , rather than going to a Con as had been intended .\nBut it was a costly exercise .\nFor this malarkey on election eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabinet list \u2014 he is now minister for egg beaters , sadness , and the town of Kettering , Tasmania \u2014 and the Somyurek-engineered Centre Alliance broke up .\nNow , the rats are leaving the sinking Shorts .\nThey know that the killing season has begun , and the new dominant groups are going to try and carve up this faction gang once and for all .\nBut why now ?\nWell , the public got a hint of such with a couple of preelection stories in The Age about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s \u201c Operation Daintree \u201d , an investigation into the several million dollars worth of government funding for training , put into a union , which never spent it for that purpose .\nWhich union ?\nWhy it \u2019 s the HWU , of course , run by Diana Asmar , and formerly managed by the late Kimberley Kitching , whose widower is Shorten consigliere and disgraced-everything Andrew Landeryou .\nAs The Age reported , $ 3.4 million in total was given to the HWU on the eve of the 2018 state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAccording to Paul Sakkal \u2019 s report , initially , $ 1.2 million had been sought , but before the tender had even been finalised , Andrews and Jill Hennessy , who was health minister at the time , announced an additional $ 2.2 million seven days before the initial contract was awarded .\nA small amount of the money actually went to the HWU \u2019 s separate training outfit , a company called the Health Education Federation .\nThe contract wasn \u2019 t tendered out : there was allegedly departmental advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor quality .\nThen , oh dear , COVID hit , and the training \u2014 around protecting health workers from violence \u2014 couldn \u2019 t be done .\nSo where has the sodding money gone ?\nThat \u2019 s what IBAC is investigating .\nAfter The Age sent questions to IBAC regarding the Daintree report leaked to them , IBAC sought and got an injunction , preventing the publication of any material within it .\nDoubtless , Andrews and Hennessy had only one thought when they sent $ 3.4 million the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election : the cause of violence-protection training in hospitals is so urgent that normal due diligence couldn \u2019 t interfere with the cause of the workers .\nYet , it would have made the HWU and the Shorten faction very happy campers in 2018 .\nWhy ?\nBecause the HWU leadership had driven the union to the brink of bankruptcy in 2016 .\nAs Ben Schneiders and Royce Millar reported in 2016 in The Age , the HWU ( it \u2019 s actually named the Health Services Union , No.1 Branch ; Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid the stink of its former leader , convicted thief Kathy Jackson ) , was close to insolvency , having burnt through $ 3.2 million in operating losses over the previous two years , and avoiding insolvency by selling its building in 2016 .\nAsmar had paid herself $ 180,000 a year throughout , and ran expensive freeway billboard ads featuring herself , as a \u201c recruiting \u201d tool .\nAs The Age had earlier reported , Asmar \u2019 s husband , David Asmar , had fled to Lebanon when investigated over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giftcards and all done from one computer at\u2026 yes , you guessed it , the HWU office .\nStill , despite all that , maybe they could do worker training , right ?\nWrong .\nBoth Asmar and Kitching were found to have sat certification tests for other officials ( to get qualifications required to have the right to visit workplaces , as organisers ) , and to have presented unreliable evidence to the Fair Work Commission .\nAsmar had her right to enter workplaces removed as a result .\nWho better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $ 3.4 million of taxpayers \u2019 money to \u2014 for the purpose of much-needed training of some of the lowest-paid , most vulnerable workers in the state \u2014 than this crew ?\nAnd where has this bloody money actually gone ?\nWell , presumably Operation Daintree has found out .\nDid IBAC injunct The Age to prevent the report leak because it is still chasing up leads in the scandal ?\nOr because it didn \u2019 t want to be accused of a \u201c James Comey \u201d by not opposing leakage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Operation Daintree report lays out the full story of the HWU , as well as of the litters of dogs in its leadership who have used and abused it and its members over the years , then it would have been a scandal that even Matthew Guy \u2019 s Liberals could have done something with \u2014 a real smoking ruin .\nAs it was , not only did we not get to see the report , but it involved no public hearings , as outgoing IBAC commissioner Robert Redlich noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be separated from political interference .\nThe Age notes that it has not been suggested that the HWU leadership is guilty of full corruption , skimming money from the $ 3.4 million , so much as a general process of floating different power groupings in the Labor empire to keep things sweet .\nAs far as visible leadership goes , that may be so .\nBut there are layers within layers of any union , and multiple people have authority for the disbursement of ongoing small sums \u2014 or can simply access bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , in particular , whether the late Kitching was a direct recipient of money diverted from this $ 3.4 million haul , piped towards her by persons unknown .\nShe had already rorted the HWU when she was appointed \u201c general manager \u201d of the union , after the Shorts faction had managed to win control of it from the SDA ( i.e .\nShoppies ) faction .\nKitching had simply used the HWU salary as a grant to pursue her political ambitions inside Labor .\nIs it possible she was accessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign to retain her number one Senate spot , which she was in danger of losing once Shorten had left the leadership ?\nIf that \u2019 s the case , then a source of the stress that some say contributed to her fatal heart attack may not have been ( and never was ) the alleged bullying by other Labor senators , but could have been the knowledge that IBAC was , however lumberingly , on the trail of this $ 3.4 million transfer .\nThat \u2019 s a possible explanation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location of the missing money may prove hard to pinpoint .\nI guess we \u2019 ll find out eventually .\nThe question is , once this report comes out , how far back up the Labor tree will it reach ?\nThe leadership of the Victorian Labor Party have been involved in funnelling $ 3.4 million of taxpayers \u2019 money to an incompetently led , perpetually near-insolvent union .\nWhy ?\nWhere are its members \u2019 dues going , year after year ?\nTo fund a poorly designed training scheme , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her organiser rights over a training rort .\nWell , one principle has already gone .\nJill Hennessy , the health minister at the sharp end of shooting this money to the HWU , a minister spoken of by some as a future leader and premier , quit in December 2020 .\nShe cited the usual \u201c family and personal \u201d reasons for departing a party cruising towards a 2022 victory , giving up another six to 10 years in power and a strong demand that Dan \u2019 s eventual replacement be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , that a powerful woman was being lost to personal matters , and a cheeky headline in The Age for those in the know ( \u201c Attorney-General Hennessy quits to spend more time with her children \u201d ) .\nBut , you know , in the end , it \u2019 s all about family .\nThat leaves only Premier Daniel Andrews in the spotlight for this shoddy arrangement .\nHow much is the Operation Daintree report going to ping him when it becomes public ?\nWill he need to consider his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph ?\nIn this respect , it \u2019 s worth noting an Andrew Bolt piece published the day after the recent Victorian election in the Sunday Herald Sun ( here \u2019 s the free Daily Mail rip-off for non-Hun subscribers ) .\nBolt \u2019 s readership is all cooker now but he \u2019 s not a cooker himself , and so his call for Dan to resign may be a nap bet on some inside knowledge .\nHe was friends with the late Kitching and all this crowd , and so he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how close Daintree will get to some very murky practices .\nOnce again , we \u2019 ll soon see .\nSo where are they all now ?\nBill Shorten is rubbing two sticks together to try and keep his media profile alight .\nAdem Somyurek is desperately hoping that the 29th preferences of the No More UFO Anal Probes Party will get him elected as a Democratic Labour Party rep in the Legislative Council .\nThe old Gray Wolf ain \u2019 t what she used to be .\nStephen Conroy has moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ASPI , the defence-contractor-funded lobby group desperate for unending Australian rearmament , while Conroy \u2019 s \u201c successor \u201d \u2014 really perpetual lieutenant \u2014 Richard Marles is in Washington , DC , promising our commitment to a war over Taiwan .\nThe mighty Australian Labor Party , marching us to war for Lockheed Martin .\nKathy Jackson , a convicted thief of union funds , has won $ 3 million from the will of a QC with dementia , a will she typed up for him , but is also being pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funds she rorted .\nDiana Asmar is still in charge of the HWU , hoping for an eventual preselection .\nAnd seven footsoldier MPs quit a dying faction \u2014 unless of course this move is an entrist ruse for factional survival arggghhhhh \u2014 and all the public sees of it is a \u201c recruitment triumph \u201d by the state Socialist Left .\nAnd the actual members of the HSU1/HWU ?\nThe low-paid workers who do your lifesaving medical tests and mop up your blood and piss , and a hundred things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit during COVID ?\nThese workers are still being ripped off , badly served , piss-poorly represented and possibly rorted by the administration of a union that was captured 20 years ago by a bunch of mouldering , right-wing , ex-student politicians .\nAll that time , Labor , the ACTU and everyone else has allowed them to fuck their members over , year on year on year , because it is more convenient to do so to keep a deranged subfaction happy than it is to actually tackle the deep rot within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe continued tolerance of this shames everyone involved , and the stain of that guilt hangs on very many hands indeed .\nIf this is finally coming to a crisis , and if it takes a few promising careers with it , then that is nothing less than deserved for the complacency and lassitude shown to the issue of union representation and party democracy over two decades .\nIndeed , such minor players may go , while the principals survive , which will be a fitting punishment for the minor players indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , I will not be surprised if they all get out of it once more , farce trumping tragedy .\nYes , IBAC is just words and whispers .\nBut words can kill and there might be a lot of deconstructing going on as , one way or another , Daintree Wood comes to Danistan .", "author": "Guy Rundle", "url":

not to some degree reverse-engineered from political optimisation back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the price cap sets the price substantially above the level of profitability : gas used to trade at $ 5 a gigajoule before the LNG cartel ramped prices to export parity .\nIt was $ 10 less than two years ago .\nCost of production is roughly $ 5GJ now , but spot prices are up to $ 25GJ .\nSo why cap at $ 12GJ ?\nSo , rather than stripping big gas , it locks in excess profits \u2014 just not ludicrous , war-profiteer profits .\nBig gas keeps up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , long enough to get the half-billion in direct payments .\nNice little earner .\nBut it \u2019 s the politics that matters .\nThis is Labor \u2019 s chance to really establish its dominance as the party of the nation , and the Coalition as the client party of interests , subject to hysteria , and disregarding the needs of the public .\nIf the Coalition really does stumble into opposing cheaper energy prices \u2014 whether or not they eventuate \u2014 it will be identified with the most-hated corporations , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image for Labor to end the year on .\nThe possibility that the Coalition may wander into this punch arises not only from its fealty to big gas , but also the residual presence of ideologues , opposed to state control of price \u201c signals \u201d at any cost .\nThis is the problem every centre-right party is facing at the moment .\nIn the second half of the 2010s , they all rushed away from austerity budgeting and the small government ethos that underlay it and embraced various forms of populism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill has now come due , and genuine economic nationalism is demanded , and the right can \u2019 t deliver .\nIt is cracking them apart , as in the UK , with the 44 days of the Truss government .\nIn the US , populist Republicans suggested that the party should support the US national railworkers \u2019 strike , and outflank the Democrats .\nAnd in Australia , we have the right blathering on again about Robert Menzies and the \u201c forgotten people \u201d speech ( FPS hereafter ) .\nYou think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the notorious FPS ?\nHa ha , you wish .\nAfter the Victorian election debacle , it was stung back to it , with a bit of a sob-a-thon on the Sky coverage , then a mention in various op-eds , and then the centrepiece , yet another speech by Tony Abbott to the Menzies Research Centre , published in the Oz .\nThe frequency of this has become bizarre now , a form of ancestor worship and necro-frotting .\nAbbott \u2019 s article is self-parodic , giving a Mincusian retrospective justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed emissions reductions , etc etc .\nThe right keeps invoking Menzies because it now doesn \u2019 t know who the \u201c forgotten people \u201d are , or what they want .\nMenzies \u2019 \u201c forgottens \u201d , he judged , wanted a bit more room to move , a bit less pressure from big forces .\nBut he appealed to them in the midst of the total war reorganisation of World War II when the hand of the state lay hard .\nNow the people being crushed are being crushed by corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number includes benefit recipients and small businesspeople , precarious workers and lower-paid rural families , and so on .\nLabor can reach across , and respond to , all these groups ; the Liberals are hamstrung by the division between large and small capital , and the fact that the division no longer runs down the capital-labour division .\nThe smart move for the Coalition in this Christmas showdown would be to tuck in behind Labor , support the price cap , and let the Greens attack Labor cleanly from the left .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ big .\nThey should propose the nationalisation/socialisation of what is a de facto monopoly gas cartel , in a phased process using compulsory purchase , through compelled share issues to government .\nThe gas cartel would retain some minority shareholding , and get some cash compensation , and the industry would then be managed by a public board , steered by the principles of lowered costs for ordinary consumers , surplus for reinvestment ( steadily shifting from gas to renewables ) , combined with a steady phasing out of the product altogether .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ between household power and other expenses , that would be a very attractive idea indeed .\nWill the Coalition get smart about who the real \u201c forgotten people \u201d are ?\nOdds are it won \u2019 t and can \u2019 t , and it will go down defending oligarchic windfall capital against the Australian people , against a measure that may make no difference at all .\nChristmas theatre , a real naivete scene .\nGod bless us one and all !", "author": "Guy Rundle", "url":

resolution in the national firearms agreement adopted after that tragedy , Australia doesn \u2019 t have a proper national registry of guns and gun owners .\nRegistries are still being enforced by states and territories .\n\u201c In 1996 , every jurisdiction agreed to a minimum set of standards for the use of firearms , \u201d Australian Gun Australian Gun Safety Alliance convenor Stephen Bendle told Crikey .\nsaid .\n\u201c After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single jurisdiction is fully compliant with the national firearms agreement .\n\u201c We \u2019 re currently reliant on seven different systems from the states and territories .\nThe Commonwealth has a system that tracks data on individual firearms , but it would be better to have one system that every police force uses , that every policeman can access , so they know who has a firearm , where they live , and what the risks are.\n\u201d Bendle said another problem was that the federal system tracks guns , but not gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers agreed a better national database was badly needed .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a no-brainer , but it keeps getting pushed to the side , \u201d Australian Federal Police Association media and government

among six killed in a shooting on a rural Queensland property last week , it appears there could be a political will to revisit the gun registry issue .\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday he would be briefed on \u201c practical ways \u201d in which gun rules could be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wake of the tragedy on the Darling Downs that occurred just a week ago , this

puts forward.\n\u201d It isn \u2019 t clear how the slain shooters in the Queensland tragedy obtained their guns but the state \u2019 s police force told Crikey whether they did so illegally @ @ @ @ @

Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( AAT ) in 2017 after spending more than 10 years deciding appeals against social security and child support decisions according to the law and the merits of each case ( \u201c Labor aims to have new AAT up and running by October \u201d ) .\nIn those days merit was also the basis of selection for membership of the tribunal .\nBefore my retirement , I noticed that new appointments seemed to be based more on political affiliation than merit .\nI also set aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were clearly not based on the law , and the fact that the government ignored the tribunal \u2019 s feedback that the debts were illegal further strengthened my view that the government had abandoned standards of integrity in favour of cronyism and theft from the most disadvantaged in the community .\nMark Dreyfus is right to abolish the AAT and start again , with the emphasis once again on merit in selection of members and in the appeal decisions .\nJohn Adams writes : The stacking of the AAT is appalling cronyism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed , but not for revenge as suggested by the bleating of Julian Leeser .\nListening to him helps to understand how corrupt that Coalition government was and wonder at its attempts to maintain the high ground in this debate .\nContemptible .\nChris Lewis writes : Hats off to Mark Dreyfus for stepping up and restructuring the AAT , a very important body that had been shamelessly stripped of its independence and value by the previous government .\nThis tragedy for democracy had to be reversed .\nDon Matthews writes : So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal control of decision-making .\nBut Labor on the other hand stacks to advance Labor ideals and take control of decision-making .\nThis is unjust .\nOnly Liberals have pure hearts and are thus the only ones who should rule .\nLabor will destroy government if it is allowed to stack .\nRoy Ramage writes : No , this is not Labor taking revenge .\nThe appointment of \u201c mates \u201d by the
